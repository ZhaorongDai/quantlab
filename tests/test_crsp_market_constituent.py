"""`CrspMarketConstituentDataset` -- the whole-market in-listing mask.

What this panel is FOR, and therefore what has to be true of it: a whole-market
price panel is mostly NaN, and without a mask a consumer cannot tell "this
security had not listed yet" from "this security listed but did not trade".
The first is not a missing observation; it is a column that does not exist yet.

Four properties, in the order they can break:

1. The mask's `symbol` axis is the int64 PERMNO, the SAME identifier
   `CrspStockDataset` keys its price columns by. If this drifts the mask stops
   lining up with the panel and every `.where()` silently misaligns.
2. Both edges come from the DATA, never from the clock. `_densify` extends an
   open interval to wall-clock today, which on a universe panel is look-ahead
   written into the mask.
3. The security filter is part of the panel's IDENTITY, not a default someone
   remembers. Two filters are two different universes.
4. A security is in the mask exactly on the days it was listed AND of the
   requested type -- not before, not after.
