"""Home for the read-only source-inspector proofs: ROADMAP success criteria
SC-3 and SC-4, requirements D-08..D-11.

SC-3 — the read surface answers inventory, coverage, failures and browsing with
NO credentials present and zero vendor requests.
SC-4 — the coverage judgement it reports is computed by the same code the real
acquisition run uses, not a second implementation that can drift.

Scaffolded by plan 03.4-01 (Wave 0). `quantlab/acquisition/_support/inspector.py` does
not exist yet; plan 03.4-04 builds it and fills this file in.

TWO RULES THIS FILE IS SUBJECT TO, both from incidents recorded in
`.planning/STATE.md`:

1. EVERY test here must be a real assertion. A pytest file with zero tests
   exits **5** ("no tests ran"), which a per-file command reads as green, so a
   placeholder, a body that is only a no-op statement, or a skip/xfail marker
   is indistinguishable from a passing file.

   On pytest 9.1.1 exit 5 is ALSO what a `-k` selector matching nothing
   produces ("no tests collected (N deselected)"). Which of the two is a bug
   depends on which was expected: for this scaffold file, exit 5 is the
   failure it exists to prevent; for the rule-2 selectors below it is the
   required result. The three tests below each pin a
   piece of infrastructure the plan-04 work depends on, against the code as it
   stands today.

2. A `-k` selector name must not be attached to a test that does not honestly
   cover that selector's behaviour -- in 03.2 a deleted mechanism left
   `-k fingerprint` green because its only covering test was named outside the
   selector. So no test here is named for a selector `03.4-VALIDATION.md`
   assigns to a later plan (`without_credentials`, `zero_vendor_requests`,
   `inspector_binds_no_client`, `coverage_is_the_same_code`,
   `browse_requires_symbols_and_window`, `browse_prunes`). Those must match
   ZERO tests until the behaviour exists.
