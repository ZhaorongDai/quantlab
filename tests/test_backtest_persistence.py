"""Locks for a backtest run's persistent record (phase 03.7, plan 09).

D-24: every run writes its own directory `output_dir/{class}_{timestamp}/`
holding config.json, weights.zarr, equity.zarr (value, returns), predictions.zarr,
settlements.json, metrics.json, report.html and run.json, which records the data
fingerprints and the market (read through `BacktestRun`, #133). An existing
directory is never overwritten, and every JSON artifact is strict JSON (NaN and
inf persisted as null, timestamps as ISO strings).

The run's results are read back through `BacktestRun` (#134). File names stay
literal only where the on-disk layout is the subject: the directory listing of
D-24, the strict-JSON check over every JSON file, the existing directory that is
never overwritten, and the recipe holding no run record (its `config.json` read
directly). The report's HTML is read with `BacktestRun.report()`.

D-27: the run records a data fingerprint for every dataset it read -- the price
dataset over the fill and valuation columns, each factor's dataset over the
columns it consumes, including the warm-up bars -- and a rebuild that supplies
`expected_fingerprint` warns (and still completes) when a digest, range or
count differs. Datasets get appended to, and Tiingo re-bases adjusted prices
after new dividends, so a re-run must detect that its data changed rather than
silently disagree with the stored run.

Why the fingerprint must be NaN-canonical: NaN has many bit patterns. Two reads
of one store, or two code paths producing "missing", can carry NaNs with
different payload bits that compare as the same missing value but hash
differently byte for byte. Without canonicalizing NaN (and -0.0 vs 0.0) before
hashing, an unchanged store could report a changed digest, and a warning that
fires on unchanged data is a warning people learn to ignore.

D-23 / D-21 / D-08: report.html is one self-contained page around a plotly
figure. It states its dates as TEXT -- the window and bar count, the training
window and the in-sample/out-of-sample ranges, every string byte-identical to
the same run's metrics.json -- carries the whole/in-sample/out-of-sample
metrics as an HTML table, and draws named traces on three rows of a shared time
axis: "equity" on x, "drawdown" on x2, and "monthly_return". Forced
delisting settlements are NOT drawn on the chart (quick 260916-hro) even for a
run that settled one, while settlements.json still records them in full; that pairing
is asserted in one place below. The in-sample range is shaded when the
window overlaps training, there is no benchmark trace, and the note that
short-side returns are optimistic because no borrow cost is modelled still
appears. metrics.json carries the same note and no benchmark key.

Phase 03.8 (D-02): a second note states that the trade metrics are the
position-level view -- one entry-to-flat round trip per symbol, so a partial
trim is not counted as its own closed trade -- and that `whole` carries
`Total Orders`, the number of fills. This file locks that at the artifact
level: the note verbatim in the page and in metrics.json, the top-level trade
metrics strict-JSON clean, and no nested `whole.positions` block left behind.
The proof that the reported view really IS the positions view (rather than a
copy of the exit-trades one) needs a run that trims without closing, and lives
in tests/test_backtest_engine.py.

The metric table is rendered from whatever keys the blocks carry at render
time, never from a list written into the report module: the metric set is
moving to vectorbt's own, and the report is written inside the staging
directory of a run, so a report that hardcoded metric names would raise on the
day that lands and take the entire run directory with it. That property is
proved at the leaf level in tests/test_backtest_report.py.

Tracking (the config's `tracker`, ADR 0015) is covered in
tests/test_backtest_tracking.py.

Everything is synthetic, CPU-only and offline.
