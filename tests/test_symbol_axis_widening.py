"""Direction 1: widening an existing store's symbol axis in place (260906-x2s).

A periodic US-equity refresh HALTS on the first new listing. `XrBackend.append`
-> `_assert_append_compatible` refuses a changed `symbol` coordinate, and it is
RIGHT to: raw `to_zarr(mode="a", append_dim=...)` silently overwrites the stored
labels, so a window carrying `{A, ARM}` written into a store holding `{A, XYZ}`
leaves XYZ's history attributed to ARM with nothing raised and nothing
recoverable afterwards (measured 2026-09-06).

This module pins the opt-in that gets PAST that refusal without weakening it.
`widen_and_append` reindexes BOTH the store and the incoming window onto
`sorted(stored | incoming)` and then calls the UNCHANGED `append()` -- so the
guard still runs and passes on its own terms, by construction rather than by
exemption. A caller who did not opt in still gets the refusal; that half is
pinned next door, in
`tests/test_chunked_ingest.py::test_plain_append_still_refuses_a_labels_differ_axis_of_the_same_length`.

Every test here names, in its docstring, the mutation that reddens it. This
project has ten recorded instances of a test passing for the wrong reason; a
test whose reddening mutation is unstated is a test nobody can check.

WHY EVERY TEST HERE RUNS TWICE, AND WHY THIS SUITE NEEDS ITS OWN LOCK
(260908-dvv). Like its two sibling suites, every test here built its `symbol`
coordinate from a python list literal, which round-trips through zarr to a
FIXED-WIDTH unicode store -- while the store the current chunked ingest writes
is `object`-encoded and decodes to `StringDType()`. So the coordinate now comes
from `conftest.symbol_coord` and every test takes the `symbol_encoding`
fixture, giving each one a `[fixed_width]` and a `[variable_length]` id.

But the defect that motivated all of this -- `widen_data_vars` rebuilding the
store's coordinates from the opened dataset and writing them back -- does NOT
reach `widen_symbol_axis`, which never builds the filler. Measured 2026-09-08
against `quantlab/dataset/backend.py` at `dea1e85`, this suite scores ZERO red
in either arm. That is CORRECT, not a shortfall, and it is recorded here so
nobody later "fixes" the zero by contriving a fixture to reach a defect that
genuinely is not on this path.

This suite's guarantee comes from a different observable instead:
`assert_stored_symbol_encoding(path, symbol_encoding)` after every widen that
is expected to SUCCEED. It is the only thing that can see a widen which raises
nothing, passes every value, dtype, NaN and chunk assertion, and silently
rewrites the store's coordinate encoding underneath. Its reddening mutation is
named in each carrying test's docstring.

    of the append-dim overlap refusal. It closes by calling the UNCHANGED
    `append()`, which its docstring already declares load-bearing precisely so
    guards keep applying on the widened path -- so the new overlap guard
    covers it for free.

    The proof is MESSAGE EQUALITY, not merely that both paths raise. Two
    stores start identically; one takes a plain `append()` of an overlapping
    window on the existing roster, the other takes a `widen_and_append()` of
    the same overlapping window carrying an ADDED symbol C so the widen
    genuinely runs. With each store's own path normalised out, the two
    messages must be byte-identical. A second, separately-worded check inside
    `widen_and_append` cannot produce that equality -- which is exactly what
    makes this an enforcement of D-03 rather than a restatement of it.

    Also asserted: the ACCEPTED side effect, now recorded in
    `quantlab/dataset/backend.py::XrBackend.widen_and_append`'s docstring. The
    widen COMMITS before the closing `append()` raises, so the store's symbol
    axis MAY have grown to A, B, C while its timestamp axis is still the
    original three labels -- unique, monotonic, and with A's and B's stored
    values on those timestamps unchanged. That is the guarantee worth holding;
    asserting instead that the symbol axis stayed narrow would be asserting
    that `widen_and_append` does NOT delegate, which is the opposite of D-03.

    RED under: adding a second, differently-worded overlap check at the top of
    `widen_and_append` so it raises before delegating (this module's own
    mutation M4, distinct from 260908-dvv's `assign_coords` M4 below).

    The encoding assertion is RED under 260908-dvv's M4, on
    `[variable_length]` alone. It is asserted on the store AFTER the closing
    `append()` raised, which is the interesting moment: the widen COMMITTED,
