"""Home for the sidecar-durability proofs: requirement D-20.

D-20 — no same-source file lock is introduced (a lock was considered and
rejected), but the AMENDED decision brings atomic sidecar WRITES into scope:
watermark sidecars must be written the way `PageLedger._flush` already writes
its ledger, through ONE shared helper rather than a third hand-rolled copy
(L-4, "Don't Hand-Roll").

Scaffolded by plan 03.4-01 (Wave 0) and filled in by plan 03.4-03, which
extracted `quantlab/utils/atomic.py:write_json_atomically` and routed all four
sidecar writers through it.

The first two tests bracket that change from both sides:

- the PRECEDENT the extraction copies is proven to work before it is copied,
  so a regression in the extracted helper is attributable rather than being
  discovered as "the ledger was always like this";
- the BLAST-RADIUS BOUND the amendment relies on (a corrupt sidecar reads back
  as absent rather than raising) is asserted for the code as it stands TODAY,
  so it can be re-asserted unchanged after the atomic write lands. A property
  only asserted after a change cannot tell you the change preserved it.

RULES THIS FILE IS SUBJECT TO (incidents recorded in `.planning/STATE.md`):
every test must be a real assertion, because a pytest file with zero tests
exits **5** ("no tests ran") and a per-file command reads that as green; and
no test is named for a selector a later plan owns.

    `PageLedger._flush` writes to a `NamedTemporaryFile` in the SAME directory

    atomic) and unlinks the temp file on any exception. Two observable
    consequences, both asserted here:

    - after a successful write the directory contains the sidecar and NOTHING

      the new one, never a half-written file the next run cannot resume from.
