"""Tests for the chunked densify-and-append ingestion path (260906-13w).

The full `us_all` window (15,424 symbols x ~5,215 trading days) densifies to a
~7.2 GiB float64 grid that `StockDataset._raw_data_to_xr()` holds alongside the
~29.6M-row frame and conversion scratch -- an OOM on a 16 GiB machine. This
module pins the fix: densify and append ONE time window at a time, so peak RAM
scales with the WINDOW rather than the range (D-01).

Every test here is offline. No credential, no network, no real store beyond
`tmp_path`.

Two properties are load-bearing and are asserted structurally rather than by
sampling RSS:

- the symbol axis is computed ONCE over the whole range and every window is
  materialised on it (D-02) -- so `sizes["symbol"]` is the FULL pinned length
  in every window while `sizes["timestamp"]` is strictly shorter than the full
  axis;
- `_raw_data_to_xr()` is called ZERO times during a chunked run -- calling it
  even once would reintroduce the whole-range allocation the chunking exists
  to avoid.

    """An ACCEPTED COST, pinned rather than fixed: a store built through
    `write()` carries TWO chunk grids after a variable widen, and phase 03.6
    deliberately does not fix that.

    This arm is NOT a red-to-green repro. It measures behaviour the phase chose
    to leave alone (route (b): narrow the wording, retract the universal), and
    it exists so the cost cannot be denied later or silently changed without a
    test going red.

    WHY the sibling arms are blind to it: every other grid arm in this family
    builds its store through `_incomplete_store`, i.e. through
    `append(append_dim_size=9)` -- a store already ON the correct grid. None of
    them goes through `write()`, which is the path `BaseDataset.save()` and
    `Factor.save()` actually take. `test_a_variable_widen_leaves_one_chunk_grid_not_two`
    directly above asserts a SINGLETON grid set, and both it and this arm are
    correct at the same time: that pair IS the narrowed claim made executable.
    The widen makes the three things IT writes agree with each other; it says
    nothing about what the store already held.

    Root cause is WR-02: `XrBackend.write()` passes no `encoding` at all, so
    the creating write lands on Zarr's default grid (the panel's own full
    shape) and never on `min(APPEND_DIM_CHUNK, total)`. `Factor.update()` then
    holds no source for the store's total extent, so the filler takes
    `min(APPEND_DIM_CHUNK, filler_len)`. This predates phase 03.6 and is
    INDEPENDENT of the `--chunk` rung -- the filler's grid is decided by
    `APPEND_DIM_CHUNK` and the filler's own length alone -- which is why it
    leaves SC-1..SC-8 and the phase goal intact.

    Two measurements, so this is not read as a monkeypatch artifact. The pair
    this arm reproduces at `APPEND_DIM_CHUNK = 4`: `(10, 2)` for the
    pre-existing variable and `(4, 2)` for the new one. The decisive pair,
    measured 2026-09-13 with NO monkeypatch at the real default
    `APPEND_DIM_CHUNK = 512`, along the documented `Factor.save()` ->
    `Factor.update()` workflow: a 1000-row store came back as
    `{'close': (1000, 2)}` and the update added `'newvar': (512, 2)`.

    WHEN THIS GOES RED: `XrBackend.write()` has started pinning `encoding`
    (route (a)). That is a legitimate change, not a regression -- but it must
    not land alone. Update, in the SAME change:
    `.planning/phases/03.6-frequency-keyed-chunking-policy/deferred-items.md`
    (the accepted-cost entry), `XrBackend.widen_and_append`'s docstring (the

    This is the branch `_widen_block_rows`'s floor argument actually covers,
    and the floor alone is NOT enough here. `block_rows` comes back as
    `max(APPEND_DIM_CHUNK, 0) == 4`, so the whole 3-row incomplete store is one

    The narrow value is not hypothetical. `from_raw_data_chunked` passes
