"""Home for the progress-reporting and cancellation proofs: ROADMAP success
criterion SC-5, requirements D-16, D-17 and D-18.

SC-5 — a caller can start an acquisition programmatically, observe its
progress, cancel it at a batch boundary leaving the store resumable, and
receive a result object describing what happened.

Scaffolded by plan 03.4-01 (Wave 0), which could only pin the fixture and
arity contracts its subjects had yet to acquire. FILLED IN by plan 03.4-05:
`AcquisitionResult` arrived with 03.4-02, and `ProgressEvent`,
`ProgressReporter`, `CancelToken` and the rest of `quantlab/base/progress.py`
with 03.4-05, so every selector below now matches a real test.

TWO RULES THIS FILE IS SUBJECT TO, both from incidents recorded in
`.planning/STATE.md`:

1. EVERY test here must be a real assertion. A pytest file with zero tests
   exits **5** ("no tests ran"), which a per-file command reads as green, so a
   placeholder, a body that is only a no-op statement, or a skip/xfail marker
   is indistinguishable from a passing file. On pytest 9.1.1 that same exit 5
   is what a `-k` selector matching nothing produces; which of the two is a
   bug depends on which was expected.

2. A `-k` selector name is never attached to a test that does not honestly
   cover that selector's behaviour. `03.4-VALIDATION.md` assigns these to this
   file -- `emits_one_event_per_batch`, `a_raising_reporter_does_not_abort`,
   `tqdm_default`, `cancel_leaves_a_resumable_store`,
   `cancel_is_not_a_quota_abort`, `cancel_check_is_first`,
   `result_and_manifest_agree`, `result_is_scrubbed`, `logging_is_unchanged` --
   and until 03.4-05 they had to match ZERO tests, because in 03.2 a deleted
   mechanism left `-k fingerprint` green: its only covering test was named
   outside the selector. Each is now attached to a test whose lock was
   MUTATION-VERIFIED -- the mechanism was broken and the test observed turning
   red -- rather than merely read.

    positional call at `:966`) already destructure it. So the cancel token

    """D-18: the in-process result and the crash-durable manifest never
    contradict each other -- on a multi-pass run AND on a cancelled one.

    **What "agree" means here, since REVIEW CR-01 retired the old form.** It
    used to mean `set(result.failures) == set(manifest)`, which held because
    `_run` built both from one dict at one point -- two expressions over one
    variable evaluated once, i.e. a receipt that they were assembled together,
    not a check that either was correct. It read True during phase
    verification on top of a manifest that had just been emptied, and it also
    forced the manifest's carried-forward entries into the result, so a run
    over a disjoint roster reported a previous run's 404s as its own. The two
    are now separate values, and agreement is the relationship that is
    actually load-bearing:

    - `set(result.failures) <= set(manifest)` -- the durable record may hold
      MORE (entries carried forward from runs that are over), never fewer than
      what this run found;
    - for every key they share, the MESSAGE is identical -- neither side may
      paraphrase the other;
    - `set(result.failures) <= set(requested)` -- the result speaks only for
      the roster this run asked for.

    The strict-superset direction is pinned separately, from disk, by
    `test_a_disjoint_rerun_does_not_inherit_earlier_failures` and
    `test_the_manifest_survives_a_quota_abort_on_the_default_path`.

    Two scenarios, because they fail for different reasons (RESEARCH Pitfalls 3
    and 4):

    1. **Multi-pass.** `_run`'s resume loop merges failures across passes and
       drops symbols a later pass cleared. A result assembled from the last
       pass alone would report a clean run the manifest contradicts.
    2. **Cancelled.** `_write_failure_manifest` OVERWRITES and `_run`'s
       `failures` starts empty, so a run cancelled before it reached symbols
       that failed LAST time would write `{}` -- wiping out the operator's only
       record that those symbols are still failing. The cancel-path merge is
       what keeps the previous run's entry on disk; the cancelled run's own
       result stays empty, because it reached nothing.

    (`wait_for_quota` never set) must leave the previous run's recorded 404s on
    disk, because it never went near those symbols.

    This asserts on the manifest's CONTENTS read back FROM DISK, deliberately.
    The equality `test_result_and_manifest_agree` used to pin --
    `set(result.failures) == set(manifest)`, with `_run` building both sides
    from one `failures` dict at one point -- was a receipt that the two were
    assembled together, not a check that either was correct: during phase
    verification it read True directly on top of a manifest that had just been
    emptied. REVIEW CR-01 has since split the dict, so the sides are
    independent and the surviving relationship is containment. No assertion in
    this test compares the result object against the manifest.

    The scenario, and why each half is shaped the way it is:

    - Run 1 downloads a roster in which exactly one symbol 404s. It gets no
      watermark, so `_failures.json` is the ONLY record of why it is missing.
    - Run 2 shares the watermark root (hence the manifest) but requests a
      DIFFERENT roster, so the 404 symbol is not in `pending` and the vendor is
      never asked for it. "Never attempted" is then proved by a guard that does
      not fire, rather than asserted about a dispatch loop's internals.
    - Run 2's `kwargs` does not mention `wait_for_quota` at all, so what runs is
      `DEFAULT_WAIT_FOR_QUOTA` -- the value an operator hits, and the one the
      `us_all` backfill this phase serves is expected to end on.

    The vendor driver copies the shape of `tests/test_tiingo_quota.py`'s
    `_Vendor` / `_install_vendor` (attribution kept), narrowed to the one

    and it stays). But manifest and result were assembled from ONE dict, so
    the same merge also poured a previous run's entries into

    failures of its own. the old market download script printed

      nobody retried that symbol, so nobody may speak for it.

    "Never attempted" is asserted against the vendor's own call log rather

    Tiingo's error text echoes back the full request URL, which carries the API
    token as a query parameter -- this repository has already leaked one real
    key. So a recognisable sentinel is planted as the credential VALUE, a
    failure whose message embeds it is forced, and the sentinel is hunted in
    every direction it could travel: the result object (whole `repr`, so a
    field added later is covered without editing this test), the emitted
    events, the on-disk manifest, and the captured log records.

    The redaction marker is asserted POSITIVELY as well. Without that, the test
    would pass just as happily against an implementation that dropped the
