"""Cross-validation tests for the model layer (quick task 260914-lno).

Before this file the repository had ZERO `train_cv` tests.

The first two tests are GOLDENS captured against the pre-refactor
`quantlab/model/base.py`, before `BaseModel` was split into
`BaseModel` / `TorchModel` / `LibraryModel` and before the fold-boundary arithmetic
was pulled out of `train_cv`'s two copy-pasted branches into one generator.
They were run green on the untouched code and committed on their own, ahead of
any production change. Their assertions must not be edited afterwards: a
baseline taken AFTER an extraction can only detect later drift, never drift
the extraction itself introduced.

What the goldens pin, for a 130-timestamp panel and
`train_cv(train_periods=50)`:

- exactly 8 fold directories `{cls}_cv_fold_{i}` (i = 0..7), each holding
  exactly `{cls}_cv_fold_{i}.pth` and `config.json`;
- the dates each fold ACTUALLY trained on: training indices `i*10 .. i*10+49`,
  test indices `i*10+50 .. i*10+59`, rendered with `np.datetime_as_string`
  from the collected panel's own timestamp coordinate.

2026-09-27, issue #34: `gap_periods` is gone, and the purge by the labels'
lookahead replaced it. The goldens were re-captured without a gap (8 folds,
test right after train), which is the one deliberate edit to them. Their
label reads no future bar, so no fold here is purged; the purge itself is
tested in `tests/test_model_purge.py`.

The dates are observed from inside training -- the stub head records
`self.config`'s four dates in `_init_optim` -- so a fold that computed the
right dates but trained on different ones still turns these tests red.

Everything is synthetic, CPU-only and offline.

2026-09-15, phase 03.7: `train_cv` now also writes `cv_folds.json` into the CV
project directory, because D-30 places the fold manifest there. The two
project-directory listings (`_assert_golden_fold_dirs` and the handmade-fold
branch test) therefore exclude exactly that one file name and assert that it
exists. No golden value changed: the fold names, the trained dates and the
per-fold directory contents are asserted exactly as captured, and the fold
geometry goldens still hold as captured before the refactor.

2026-10-03, issue #123: `train_cv` writes a walk-forward trained unit. Each
fold is the unit `fold_{i}/` holding `{cls}_cv_fold_{i}{suffix}`, and the
trial's `run.json` replaced `cv_folds.json`. The directory listings follow
that layout; the fold geometry and trained dates are unchanged.

The unit's file names appear here only in the directory-listing lock of its layout;
results are read through `TrainedRun`.
