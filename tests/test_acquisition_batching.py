"""Base-class batching, abort ordering and no-data marking (03.2 SC-1/SC-2/SC-4).

Phase 03.2 promotes the unit of acquisition work from a *symbol* to a
`(vendor, batch, page)` triple: `_fetch_page(symbols, start, end, page_token)`
becomes the single abstract fetch primitive and a single-symbol vendor is the
degenerate case (`DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE = 1`), with no placeholder anywhere in the
hierarchy (SC-1, CONTEXT.md D-01). Two orderings in the shared base are
load-bearing and invisible at runtime if they regress:

- the global-abort check must be `_attempt`'s FIRST statement -- joblib cannot
  cancel already-queued work, so an input-generator check is an optimisation,
  not the guarantee (260906-26o D-05);
- the D-04 "queried, no data" marker must be evaluated only AFTER a batch's
  last page, never per page. Alpaca is symbol-major, so page 1 of a 100-symbol
  batch legitimately holds one symbol; per-page evaluation would stamp 99
  symbols "no data", advance their watermarks and skip them forever -- a silent
  99% loss that looks like a successful run (RESEARCH Pitfall 4).

Every test here is offline. Nothing sleeps for real, makes a network call,
requires a credential, or touches any real data volume.

This file lands in 03.2-01 (Wave 0) carrying its fixture self-test; 03.2-02 and
03.2-03 fill in the behavioural tests above. It is deliberately NOT an empty
placeholder: a pytest file with zero collected tests exits 5 ("no tests ran"),
which a later task's automated command reads as green.

    Found by mutation: dropping `outcome.complete` from the marker gate left
    the whole suite green, because today `_fetch_batch` only ever returns
    normally after the vendor hands back a null page token -- so the flag is
    always true where the gate reads it and no end-to-end test can move it.
    That makes the gate look like dead code a refactor may delete, and the
    first `_fetch_batch` that CAN return early (a page budget, the token-free
    degradation D-03 sketches) would then mark every symbol whose rows were
    simply on a page it never fetched.

    So the outcome is injected directly. This is the one place a seam-level
    substitution is the honest test: the property is `_attempt_batch`'s
    contract WITH `_fetch_batch`, not the page loop's behaviour.
