"""The FAMILY guard on the three suites that own `XrBackend`'s widening
methods (260908-dvv).

The defect this task closes was not one bad test. It was a whole FAMILY of
fixtures sharing one unrealistic assumption -- every store-touching test in
`tests/test_symbol_axis_widening.py`, `tests/test_variable_axis_widening.py`
and `tests/test_factor_update.py` built its `symbol` coordinate from a python
list literal, which round-trips through zarr to a fixed-width unicode store
while the store the real chunked ingest writes is `object`-encoded. Thirty-four
tests were rigorous inside that assumption and blind outside it, and no amount
of care spent on any INDIVIDUAL test would have surfaced it.

So the guard has to read the FAMILY. A test added next month that forgets the
encoding axis reopens the blind spot one test at a time, and nothing else in
the repository would notice: it would pass, its neighbours would pass, and the
suite total would go up.

Read through `ast`, never through a source-text scan. A grep for
`"symbol": [` is defeated by a docstring that merely MENTIONS the old spelling,
and this repository has recorded instances of exactly that -- a substring scan
matching a leftover import, a character class terminating at `(`. The parse
tree cannot be fooled by prose.

Imported as `from conftest import ...` for the reason stated at the top of
`tests/test_symbol_coord_encoding.py`: vectorbt ships a top-level regular
`tests` package that shadows this repo's `tests/` namespace portion.
