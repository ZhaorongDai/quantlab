"""Home for the data-source registry proofs: ROADMAP success criteria SC-1 and
SC-2, requirements D-01..D-07.

SC-1 — every acquirable source is enumerable from ONE registry, with no vendor
class named at the call site; each descriptor carries its capabilities, its
credential env-var NAMES and its acquisition class.
SC-2 — enumeration and credential status never return a credential VALUE and
never require one to be present.

Scaffolded by plan 03.4-01 (Wave 0) and filled in by plan 03.4-02, which built
`quantlab/acquisition/registry.py` and both vendor descriptors.

TWO RULES THIS FILE IS SUBJECT TO, both from incidents this repository has
already had (recorded in `.planning/STATE.md`):

1. EVERY test here must be a real assertion. A pytest file containing zero
   tests exits **5** ("no tests ran"), and a per-file command reads that exit
   as success. A placeholder, a body that is only a no-op statement, or a
   skip/xfail marker is therefore indistinguishable from a passing file.

   On pytest 9.1.1 that same exit 5 is ALSO what a `-k` selector matching
   nothing produces ("no tests collected (N deselected)"). The two are told
   apart by which is expected: for a scaffold file exit 5 is the failure this
   file exists to prevent; for one of the not-yet-implemented selectors listed
   in rule 2 it is the required result. Every test below is a genuine
   assertion against code that exists: the first three are the Wave-0
   infrastructure self-tests (fixture layout, credential-name anchoring), the
   rest pin the registry contract itself.

2. A `-k` selector name must not be attached to a test that does not honestly
   cover that selector's behaviour. In 03.2 a mechanism was deleted and
   `-k fingerprint` stayed green, because the only test covering it was named
   outside its own selector. Every selector `03.4-VALIDATION.md` assigns to
   this file -- `one_descriptor_per_vendor`, `capabilities`,
   `capabilities_match_the_vendor_class`, `direct_class_reference`,
   `env_names_are_exactly_what_gates_construction`,
   `never_returns_a_credential_value`, `registration_tuple_shape`,
   `decorator_registers`, `enumeration_order`,
   `enumeration_is_complete_from_a_cold_import` -- now matches at least one
   test, and each of those tests genuinely covers the behaviour its selector
   names. Renaming one of them without moving its assertions is how the 03.2
   incident repeats.

    `acquisition_config` is the fixture plan 02's registry tests and plan 04's

    - `raw_data_dir_path` TERMINATES at the vendor segment, which is the
      equality `StockDataset._scan_raw` asserts to make a cross-vendor silent

    - the watermark root is a SIBLING of the raw root, never inside it. A
      polars directory scan of the raw root walks every file beneath it, so a
      `.json` sidecar in that tree would break the scan outright -- and
      `browse_raw` (D-10) is exactly such a scan.
