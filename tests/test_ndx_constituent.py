"""Tests for the Nasdaq-100 daily membership panel (DATA-05, DATA-06).

The Nasdaq-100 counterpart of `tests/test_constituent_panel.py`: that module
owns the shared densification rules (interval closedness, right-edge horizon,
calendar-day axis, delisted columns) via no-I/O fixture subclasses, so nothing
here re-tests them. This module tests only what is specific to the second
index -- its own left edge, its own store, and the structural claim that
adding it cost nothing above `dataset/`.

Every test runs OFFLINE. The only route to the network in this code path is
`acquisition.universe.requests.get`, which the shared `mock_universe_fetchers`
fixture in `tests/conftest.py` replaces with a URL-keyed fake that raises
`AssertionError` on any unexpected URL.
