"""`BaseDataset.update()` and the evidence-driven strategy resolver
(260908-0f4 Task 2).

`update()` is the AUTOMATIC incremental entry point, symmetric with
`Factor.update()`. It takes no strategy parameter, because the widen-vs-rebuild
choice is a FACT about the raw tier rather than a caller's preference: a symbol
newly admitted to a widened roster may already carry vendor history over the
window the store covers, and a `widen` NaNs that history out with nothing to
report it. Measured on this repo's own data at planning time -- 56 symbols
present in raw and absent from the store, one of them (`VSTD`) carrying raw
rows across every timestamp the store has.

The three-way rule these tests pin:

- ANY added symbol carrying raw rows inside the store's extent -> `rebuild`;
- NO added symbol carrying such rows                           -> `widen`;
- ANY REMOVED symbol                                           -> `refuse`.

`tests/test_dataset_update_evidence.py` pins the probe itself. This module
pins what the resolver does with its answer -- including, in
`test_the_probe_is_asked_about_the_stores_extent_not_the_config_range`, WHICH
window it hands the probe, which is the one invariant no probe-layer test can
observe.

Everything here is offline: `tmp_path` stores, `tmp_path` raw trees.
