"""Pins the reconciliation between the two ends of the symbol lifecycle:
what the ROSTER BUILDER persists, and what the FETCH GUARD admits.

Quick task 260907-10t. Two separately-deliberate decisions were never pinned
against each other:

- 260906-eme decided that `us_all` deliberately RETAINS its 1,124 warrant /
  unit / right / when-issued lines -- a named, measured, carried-forward
  finding.
- 03.2-03 decided that `Acquisition._validate_symbols` admits at most ONE
  suffix segment, because a symbol becomes both a filesystem path segment and
  a comma-joined query value.

Each is correct alone. Together they mean `download()`'s whole-roster
pre-flight raises on `NXG-R-W` and kills a multi-hour full-market job before
one request is issued. Nothing in the suite could see it, because no test ever
fed the builder's OUTPUT to the guard.

That end-to-end assertion is
`test_every_symbol_either_roster_builds_is_accepted_by_the_fetch_guard` below.

    persists must be fetchable.

    Deliberately NOT a spot-check on `NXG-R-W`. A test naming individual
    symbols is precisely what would let the NEXT divergence through -- the
    previous suite named plenty of symbols and could not see this one, because
    nothing ever fed the builder's OUTPUT to the guard. This asserts on the
    ENTIRE returned symbol list of BOTH rosters, in ONE `_validate_symbols`
    call each, so any future roster shape the builder admits is covered
    automatically.

    WHAT THIS TEST DOES AND DOES NOT CATCH -- measured, not assumed. Both
    mutations the plan named were run for real:

    - Removing the build-time filter from
      `quantlab/universe.py:TiingoRosterFetcher.fetch()` REDDENS it
      (observed: `refusing to fetch 'CAPTW(EXP20260807)'`). That is the
      roster-builder end, and it is the mutation that reproduces the original
      bug.
    - Narrowing `enums.data.TRADEABLE_TICKER_PATTERN`'s suffix group back to
      `{0,1}` does NOT redden it, and that is CORRECT rather than a gap.
      Because both ends bind the SAME compiled object, the builder drops
      exactly what the guard would refuse, so this invariant holds under ANY
      pattern -- which is the entire point of sharing one object instead of
      keeping two copies equal by a test. Do not "strengthen" this test to
      catch it; that would mean re-introducing a second pattern for it to
      disagree with.

      The pattern's VALUE is pinned separately, and that mutation was
      confirmed to redden six tests across two modules, headed by
      `test_the_fetch_guard_admits_the_multi_suffix_securities_the_roster_keeps`
      here and `test_the_multi_suffix_warrants_survive_the_malformed_drop` in
      `tests/test_universe.py`. The two assertions are complementary: this one
      says the two ends AGREE, that one says what they agree ON.

    Two payloads, because each covers something the other cannot:

    1. The measured `_RECONCILIATION_CSV`, whose literals are real symbols
       from the live reference table, including all 9 malformed ones.
    2. The SHARED `mock_universe_fetchers` roster, which pins the fixture
       vocabulary itself. That half is not decoration: it is what caught
       `DELISTED1` -- nine characters with no delimiter, a shape no real US
       ticker has (the longest delimiter-free live symbol is seven), which the
       guard had silently refused for as long as it existed.
