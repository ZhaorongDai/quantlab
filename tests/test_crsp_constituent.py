"""The two CRSP-vendor universes as membership panels (D-01, D-05, D-14).

`tests/test_crsp_membership.py` owns the interval half: which securities were
in an index, on which dates, from the reference tier alone. This module owns
the step that makes those intervals usable beside a price panel, and the two
ordinary `IndexConstituentDataset` subclasses built on top of it.

**Why the agreement test is the load-bearing one.** A universe mask is applied
to a price panel by SYMBOL, and since 03.11-03 a CRSP panel's `symbol` IS the
int64 PERMNO. If the two sides spelled identity differently -- one in tickers,
one in PERMNOs -- the mask would select nothing and the run would report an
empty universe rather than an error. The structural defence is no longer a
shared ticker RULE but a shared IDENTIFIER: the panel casts the raw PERMNO
column and the universe reads PERMNO spells straight out of
`dsp500list_v2`/`ccmxpf_lnkhist`, so there is no derivation left to disagree
about. `test_membership_symbols_agree_with_the_crsp_price_panel` proves it end
to end, through a real pull and a real conversion, not by inspecting the call
graph.

**Provenance rule, continued from plan 02.** Every row below is either
VERBATIM from a named live-check key (through `tests/crsp_fixtures.py`) or
carries a `# SYNTHETIC` comment on the spot.

**Membership assertions are deliberately dtype-AGNOSTIC; the axis has its own
two tests.** `test_the_constituent_panel_symbol_coord_is_int64` and
`test_the_constituent_panel_symbol_coord_is_numerically_ordered` are the only
place the dtype and the order are claimed, and they are two separate
assertions on purpose (03.11 Pitfall 2): "the mask can be computed" is ALSO
true when both sides quietly fall back to a lexicographic string axis, so it
is not evidence of anything. Everywhere else `_label()` resolves a PERMNO to
whatever the axis happens to spell it as, which keeps the membership claims
about MEMBERSHIP.

**Every quantlab import lives inside a test or inside a helper.** That is not
style: this module is written before the two constituent classes exist, and a
module-scope import would turn the RED run into a COLLECTION error -- zero
tests discovered, which proves nothing about the behaviour (TDD gate #3770).
