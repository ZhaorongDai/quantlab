"""Page-level resume across a batched, paginated vendor fetch (03.2 SC-3, D-05).

A `us_all` backfill issues thousands of multi-symbol batch requests, and Alpaca
returns each batch as an opaque-token-chained sequence of pages sorted by
symbol first, then by bar timestamp. Restarting an interrupted run from the
start of a batch re-burns every page already paid for; restarting from the
wrong page silently drops the symbols in between. `base/pageledger.py:PageLedger`
records the furthest position reached per batch so a resumed run continues
mid-batch, and records enough alongside the verbatim token to re-derive a
resume point WITHOUT one, because Alpaca publishes no statement about token
lifetime either way (CONTEXT.md D-03).

The token is a position, not a lease: Alpaca's own published example decodes to
`SYMBOL|TIMEFRAME|TIMESTAMP`. That encoding is undocumented, so the ledger
records tokens verbatim and never re-derives them.

Every test here is offline. The page sequence comes from `mock_alpaca_client`,
so nothing sleeps for real, makes a network call, requires `APCA_API_KEY_ID` /
`APCA_API_SECRET_KEY`, or touches any real data volume.

This file lands in 03.2-01 (Wave 0) carrying its fixture self-tests; 03.2-02
Task 3 fills in the resume / idempotency / fingerprint tests. It is
deliberately NOT an empty placeholder: a pytest file with zero collected tests
exits 5 ("no tests ran"), which a later task's automated command reads as green.
