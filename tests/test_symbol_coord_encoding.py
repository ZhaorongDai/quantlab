"""Self-tests for the shared symbol-coordinate encoding helper (260908-dvv).

`tests/conftest.py`'s `symbol_coord()` exists so that the three suites owning
`XrBackend`'s axis-widening methods build their `symbol` coordinate the way a
production panel actually carries it, rather than from a python list literal.
This module is the lock on the HELPER itself.

It exists because the realistic construction is COUNTER-INTUITIVE, and getting
it wrong reproduces the exact blind spot the helper was written to close, one
level up. Measured on this machine 2026-09-08 (numpy 2.5.2 / xarray 2026.7.0 /
zarr 3.3.0), in-memory spelling to on-disk result:

    python list literal                     -> <U{n}         BytesCodec
    np.asarray(list)                        -> <U{n}         BytesCodec
    np.array(list, dtype=object)            -> StringDType() VLenUTF8Codec
    np.array(list, dtype=StringDType())     -> <U{n}         BytesCodec
    pd.Index(list)                          -> StringDType() VLenUTF8Codec

Row four is the trap: `np.dtypes.StringDType()` NAMES the dtype production
decodes to, and lands on the WRONG arm. Only the `object` spelling reproduces
the store the shipped `ValueError` names. Without
`test_the_obvious_string_dtype_spelling_does_not_reproduce_the_production_store`
and `test_the_two_arms_are_distinct_on_disk` below, a later reader "simplifies"
the object spelling to the StringDType one, the variable-length arm silently
becomes a second copy of the fixed-width arm, and every suite stays green while
covering one encoding instead of two.

Every test here names, in its docstring, the mutation that reddens it.

Imported as `from conftest import ...` rather than `from tests.conftest import
...`: vectorbt ships a top-level REGULAR `tests` package into site-packages,
and a regular package beats this repo's `tests/` namespace portion no matter
where it sits on `sys.path`, so `tests.conftest` raises `ModuleNotFoundError`
in any freshly built venv. `conftest` is the spelling
`tests/test_ticker_pattern_reconciliation.py:276` already relies on, and it
returns the module pytest itself loaded rather than a second copy.
