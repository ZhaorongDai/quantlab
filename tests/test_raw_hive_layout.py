"""Vendor-isolated, hive-partitioned raw tier (03.2 SC-7, D-08/D-11).

Measured against polars 1.44.1 during phase research: two vendors writing the
SAME schema under one scan root do not raise, do not warn, and do not record
which vendor each row came from -- `pl.scan_parquet` simply returns their union.
`dedup_raw_frame(keep="last")` then collapses the duplicate `(timestamp, symbol)`
pairs to one, arbitrarily. The result is an untraceable blended price series
that looks exactly like clean data.

A `.../{vendor}/...` path segment alone stops none of that: it carries no `=`,
so it is not a hive key, and a scan rooted one level up walks straight into
both. Three mutually reinforcing measures make SC-7 structural, and this module
is where they are pinned:

1. `raw_data_dir_path` TERMINATES at the vendor segment, and `_scan_raw`
   asserts `Path(raw_data_dir_path).name == config.vendor`;
2. every raw shard carries a literal `vendor` column, so provenance survives
   even a merged read and the condition is DETECTABLE, not merely prevented --
   `_scan_raw` asserts `n_unique(vendor) == 1` and then drops the column;
3. the hive key is frequency-dependent (`month=` for `1d`, `date=` for `1m`,
   `date=/symbol=` for `tick`) and declared once so writer and reader cannot
   drift. Filtering on the hive key prunes at plan time; filtering on the
   `timestamp` data column does not. Both filters are required.

`extra_columns` / `missing_columns` must stay at their polars defaults. The
`SchemaError` a mixed-schema scan raises is a FEATURE here; setting
`extra_columns='ignore'` "to make the scan work" reopens the silent merge while
looking like a bug fix.

Every test here is offline: parquet under `tmp_path` only. No network call, no
credential, no real data volume.

This file lands in 03.2-01 (Wave 0) carrying its fixture self-tests; 03.2-02
Task 4 fills in the `.explain()` pruning assertion and the `_scan_raw`
behavioural tests. It is deliberately NOT an empty placeholder: a pytest file
with zero collected tests exits 5 ("no tests ran"), which a later task's
automated command reads as green.

    The hive key is a US/Eastern SESSION date; the window edges are naive-UTC

    lives under `date=2024-03-31`, yet its timestamp is INSIDE a window that
    starts at 2024-04-01T00:00. A predicate comparing the session key directly
    against `start.date()` prunes that partition away and drops the row --
    silently, and in the shape that reads as sparse data.

    The `timestamp` predicate applied alongside trims the over-included rows
    exactly, so the widening costs at most two extra partitions and buys
    correctness at both edges.

    The tree is written directly rather than through `hive_raw_tree`, because
    the whole point is a row whose SESSION partition differs from its UTC date
