"""The WRDS vendor SEAM: one account, several products (phase 03.10, plan 01).

Phase 03.9 registered the `wrds` descriptor inside the TAQ provider, beside the
one provider that existed. Plan 02 adds a SECOND provider (CRSP daily) to the
same vendor, and a registration that lives inside a provider module would then
have to name the other provider's classes -- so one provider would import the
other purely to be registered, and importing either one first would cycle
through the registry.

This file pins the shape that makes the second provider a one-row change:

- the descriptor lives in the PACKAGE ENTRY POINT,
  `quantlab/acquisition/wrds/__init__.py`, which imports the provider
  submodules; `wrds/taq.py`'s SOURCE names neither the registry nor the
  descriptor;
- the registry's bottom vendor import names the PACKAGE `wrds` and no submodule
  of it, so a cold `import quantlab.acquisition.registry` still enumerates
  every source, and so does an import that touches a provider submodule FIRST;
- the one `WrdsSession` offers GENERIC `schema_usable` / `fetch_rows` /
  `copy_csv`, so the CRSP provider reaches the shared connection without adding
  CRSP-shaped methods to a TAQ module -- and TAQ's own methods delegate to them
  without changing a byte of their SQL.

WHICH KIND OF CLAIM: since the providers became SUBMODULES of the `wrds`
package, importing one of them DOES load the entry point and therefore the
registry. `test_wrds_taq_registers_nothing_and_imports_no_registry` is
accordingly a claim about the SOURCE TEXT of `wrds/taq.py`, read with `ast`,
and NOT a claim about `sys.modules`. The runtime property did not survive the
packaging; the text rule did, and it is the rule that keeps a registration from
drifting back into a provider. The import-order tests below are the ones that
make a genuine runtime claim.

EVERY test here is OFFLINE (D-13). The autouse `_forbid_wrds_network` tripwire
in `tests/conftest.py` makes `psycopg2.connect` raise in every test; the
session tests install their own `FakeConnection` factory with
`monkeypatch.setattr("psycopg2.connect", ...)` inside the test body, which is
the only sanctioned way past it (03.9 D-28). Nothing here can push Duo.
