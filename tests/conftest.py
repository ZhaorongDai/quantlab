"""Shared pytest fixtures for the quantlab test suite.

These fixtures provide synthetic market-data inputs (Binance CSV rows, Tiingo
JSON responses, Alpaca bars-envelope pages, hive-partitioned raw parquet
trees) and mocked vendor clients so downstream tests never need a real network
call or a real API credential.

IMPORTANT: this module must have zero import-time dependency on
`acquisition.tiingo`, `acquisition.alpaca`, `base.pageledger` or `utils.cli`.
None of those existed when the fixtures that reference them were written
(`acquisition.tiingo` as of Phase 2 Wave 1; `acquisition.alpaca`,
`base.pageledger` and `utils.cli` as of Phase 03.2 Wave 1), so that
`pytest --collect-only` succeeds today regardless of which feature plans have
landed. `mock_tiingo_client` and `mock_alpaca_client` reference their targets
only as dotted strings inside `monkeypatch.setattr(..., raising=False)`,
evaluated lazily when the fixture is used by a test, never at module import
time. Keep it that way: a top-level `import acquisition.alpaca` here would
break collection of the ENTIRE suite until that module lands.

#
# Root cause: xgboost's macOS wheel links Homebrew's libomp, torch bundles its
# own libomp. In one process the two runtimes clash -- torch-then-xgboost
# segfaults (OMP: Error #179), xgboost-then-torch deadlocks.
# A ctypes RTLD_GLOBAL preload of Homebrew libomp was tried and REJECTED: it
# fixed torch-then-xgboost but made torch's own GRU forward and a 20k-row
# cross_entropy segfault with no xgboost involved (measured 2026-09-14,
# fresh subprocesses). Forcing single-threaded OpenMP was the only setting
# that passed the full mixed torch/xgboost/threaded-xgboost sequence.

    1. `March 2, 2018` -- `TEMP1` added / `LOGI` removed. Closes LOGI's
       interval, so LOGI is a former member with a real `end_date`.
    2. `February 1, 2007` -- `LOGI` added / `CMVT` removed. This is the REAL
       earliest row on the live page and is what makes
       `PIT_COVERAGE_START = "2007-02-01"` (RESEARCH Finding 2). `CMVT` is
       itself left-censored here.
    3. `January 3, 2011` -- `NEWMEM` added, blank removed cells. An **add-only**
       row (18 of the live page's 226 rows are add-only, RESEARCH Finding 3).
    4. `June 15, 2015` -- blank added cells, `GONE1` removed. A **drop-only**
       row AND left-censored: `GONE1` is never added anywhere in this fixture,
       so it must start at `PIT_COVERAGE_START` with a WARNING.

    READ ROW FOUR TWICE. `np.dtypes.StringDType()` is the dtype
    `xr.open_zarr` DECODES a production coordinate to, so it is the spelling
    that looks correct -- and it writes a FIXED-WIDTH array, i.e. the wrong
    arm. Only the `object` spelling reproduces the store the shipped
    `ValueError` names. Simplifying `dtype=object` to `dtype=StringDType()`
    here would silently turn the variable-length arm into a second copy of
    the fixed-width one, with every suite still green.
    `tests/test_symbol_coord_encoding.py` exists to make that impossible;
    do not change this function without reading it.

    The fixed-width arm is `np.asarray(list(symbols))`, letting numpy resolve
    the natural `<U` width. That is deliberately byte-identical to what the
    owning suites' list literals already produced, so that arm is an
    unchanged CONTROL rather than a new case.
