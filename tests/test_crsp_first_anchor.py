"""The `.first()` adjustment anchor: the four invariants that pin the switch.

Phase 03.12 moves the CRSP adjustment anchor from "the LAST usable row inside
the conversion window" (forward adjustment) to "the PERMNO's FIRST usable row
inside the store" (backward adjustment). The anchor then never moves under an
append-only store, which is the whole point: a store that only grows forward
stops restating its own history.

Four invariants carry that claim, and this module is where they live:

- **I-1** the anchor row's `adjClose` IS its own `close`, and the same row's
  `adjVolume` IS its own `volume`;
- **I-2** a full build and an incremental build agree bit for bit (plan 02);
- **I-3** switching the anchor is a CONSTANT per-PERMNO rescale -- any seam
  (one column carrying two anchors) makes the ratio vary in `t`;
- **I-4** the day-over-day ratios are untouched by the switch -- only the
  scale changes, never the economics.

**Every quantlab import is INSIDE a test or helper body.** That is not style:
these tests are written before the behaviour they assert on exists, and a
module-scope import would turn the RED run into a collection error -- zero
tests discovered, which proves nothing about the behaviour (TDD gate #3770).

**Provenance rule, inherited from `tests/crsp_fixtures.py`.** A row reused from
that module is VERBATIM live data; a row built here with `dsf_row` is invented
and carries a `# SYNTHETIC` comment. Every synthetic row keeps `dsf_row`'s
NS/EQTY/COM defaults, so the common-stock filter keeps it.

**Tolerances are always explicit.** I-1 is `rel=1e-12` and MUST NOT be spelled
`==`: on the real store `close_A * G_A / G_A == close_A` holds exactly for only
514 of 520 securities (RESEARCH 19.4.5). I-3 / I-4 are `rel=1e-9`, against a
measured worst case of `4.900e-16`.

    so the anchor must step forward to `2020-03-03` -- the first row carrying
    BOTH a strictly positive `close` and a non-null `dlycumfacshr`.

    On that row, and only on that row, the adjusted series is the raw series:
