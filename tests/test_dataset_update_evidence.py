"""The raw-layer evidence probe and the store-extent helper (260908-0f4 Task 1).

`update()` must choose between `widen` and `rebuild` from a FACT rather than
from a caller's preference, and the fact is this: does a newly-added symbol
already carry raw rows inside the window the store already covers? These tests
pin the two primitives that answer it -- the store's append-dim extent, and the
per-symbol in-window raw row count -- separately from the resolver that
consumes them (`tests/test_dataset_update.py`).

Everything here is offline: `tmp_path` stores, `tmp_path` raw trees, no
network, no credential.

Note what these tests deliberately do NOT carry. The probe takes its window
from its CALLER, so no test in this module can observe which window the
resolver chose to hand it; the "store extent, not config range" invariant
(D-07) is therefore only observable at the resolver and lives in
`tests/test_dataset_update.py`. Asserting it here would be a claim of coverage
that does not exist.
