"""`quantlab.registry.convert()` -- the registry-level raw->Zarr
entry point (DATA-07, phase 03.5).

The requirement these tests exist for is stated as a CALL SITE, not as a
behaviour: an in-process caller holding only a `SourceDescriptor` and a
`DatasetConfig` converts an already-persisted raw parquet tier into a Zarr
store, without naming `StockDataset`, `TiingoAcquisition` or any `ingest_*.py`
anywhere. Every test below therefore reaches the conversion through
`convert(DESCRIPTOR, config)` and never through the Dataset class -- a test
that constructed the dataset itself would pass while the requirement failed.

Offline, all of it. No credential is read, no network call is made, and every
path is under `tmp_path`. The raw tier is a hive-partitioned parquet tree
written by the shared `hive_raw_tree` fixture, in the shape
`StockDataset._scan_raw` asserts: `Path(raw_data_dir_path).name == vendor`.
