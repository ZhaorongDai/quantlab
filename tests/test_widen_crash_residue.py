"""WR-03: a `.superseded.tmp` residue wedges `XrBackend.widen_symbol_axis`.

`widen_symbol_axis`'s crash guard handles only `superseded.exists() AND NOT
target.exists()`. The fourth state -- BOTH present -- has no guard, and the
closing swap opens with `os.replace(target, superseded)`, which on POSIX raises
`ENOTEMPTY` when `superseded` is a NON-EMPTY directory. So the method estimates
the widen, routes the strategy, materialises and writes the ENTIRE
`.widening.tmp` sidecar, and only then fails: the whole rewrite paid for and
thrown away, an orphaned sidecar left on disk, and an error message that names
neither the residue nor a remedy.

The residue is reachable by two routes, and they are why the guard cannot just
delete it:

1. a widen that CRASHED between its two renames (or whose closing
   `shutil.rmtree(superseded, ignore_errors=True)` silently failed on
   permissions / NFS, or was killed mid-rmtree); and
2. a SIGKILLed `on_new_listing="rebuild"`. `BaseDataset.SUPERSEDED_SUFFIX` and
   `XrBackend.SUPERSEDED_SUFFIX` are the SAME string appended to the SAME store
   path, and `BaseDataset._restore_rebuild_asides` only runs on an exception or
   a cancel -- SIGKILL reaches neither. From then on EVERY widen against that
   store pays the full rewrite before failing.

Both producers write an indistinguishable directory, and either may hold the
ONLY complete copy of a store. That is why the non-empty case is REFUSED rather
than auto-recovered.

`03.6-REVIEW.md` recorded WR-03 as `advisory` with
`evidence_status: not independently reproduced`. Every arm here was written
RED-first against the unfixed tree (plan `03.6-10`, Task 1) so the finding is
answered with evidence rather than with a blind fix.

This is a NEW module on purpose: `tests/test_symbol_axis_widening.py` is
VERIFIED truth #21's evidence and stays UNEDITED (it already covers the
no-store-plus-sidecar refusal at `:819-846`), and `tests/test_chunked_ingest.py`
belongs to plan `03.6-08` this round.

    The residue MUST be NON-EMPTY, and that is the load-bearing condition of

    leaves behind -- the previous authoritative copy, moved aside and never
    reclaimed.
