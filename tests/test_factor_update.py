"""`Factor.update()` -- the AUTOMATIC incremental interface (260907-vyr).

`Factor` had exactly one write path, `save()`, and it is a WHOLESALE one:
zarr's `mode="a"` means "overwrite variables in an existing store", not
"append along time", so a second date range fails outright
(`tests/test_factor_save_mode.py` pins that failure and its message). The
incremental path existed one layer down -- `XrBackend.append` and, since
260906-x2s and this task, `widen_and_append` -- with no route to it from the
factor layer at all. Measured 2026-09-07: `widen_and_append` had NO production
caller anywhere in the repo, only tests.

`update()` is that route, and it is AUTOMATIC: it works out for itself what
changed -- later dates, new symbols, new variables -- and reconciles each axis
without the caller naming which widening to perform. The two interfaces are how
a caller says which it means:

    save()    writes WHOLESALE     (save(mode="w") replaces the store)
    update()  EXTENDS              (no mode, no route to overwrite a stored range)

Every test here names, in its docstring, the mutation that reddens it.

WHY EVERY STORE-TOUCHING TEST HERE RUNS TWICE (260908-dvv). `update()` reaches
`widen_and_append` and through it `widen_data_vars`, which is where the defect
described above actually shipped -- and this suite could not see it, because
`PanelFactor.cal()` built its `symbol` coordinate from a python list. That
round-trips through zarr to a FIXED-WIDTH unicode store, while the store the
real chunked ingest writes is `object`-encoded and decodes to `StringDType()`.
The coordinate now comes from `conftest.symbol_coord` and the encoding is
carried on the factor instance by `_factor(..., encoding=...)`, so seven of
the eight tests get a `[fixed_width]` and a `[variable_length]` id (the eighth
arrived with 260908-g30). Measured
2026-09-08 with `quantlab/dataset/backend.py` reverted to `dea1e85`, two of
those `[variable_length]` ids go red while every `[fixed_width]` twin stays
green.
