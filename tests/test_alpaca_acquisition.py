"""Alpaca vendor round-trip against a mocked transport (03.2 SC-5, SC-2, D-12/D-15).

`acquisition/alpaca.py:AlpacaAcquisition` is the second vendor behind the shared
`Acquisition` base. Three things about it are easy to get wrong in ways nothing
else catches:

- **429 is `rate_limited`, never `quota`.** Tiingo's 429 means the hourly
  allocation is spent and the whole run must abort (260906-26o D-05); Alpaca's
  429 means "slow down" and must back off and retry. Classifying Alpaca's 429
  as `quota` would abort a healthy 15k-symbol run on its first burst; the
  converse would grind through 10,000 fast-failing requests, which is the
  incident that produced the Tiingo abort in the first place (SC-2).
- **Credentials come from `os.environ` in `__init__`, never from the config.**
  `alpaca-py` does NOT read them from the environment despite a docstring
  implying it does (verified by grep over the 0.44.0 sdist), so this project
  reads `APCA_API_KEY_ID` / `APCA_API_SECRET_KEY` itself and keeps them off
  every config surface and out of every log line and failure manifest.
- **`asof` is sent as a real value that survives URL encoding.** Alpaca
  defaults it to the current day and maps each symbol to the entity holding it
  TODAY, so a delisted ticker silently returns the current occupant's history
  -- exactly the survivorship bias the point-in-time roster exists to remove
  (RESEARCH Pitfall 5). It is NOT enough to put the key in the params dict:
  `requests` drops None-valued params before the query string is built, so a
  dict-level assertion passes while the wire carries nothing. Every claim about
  `asof` here is therefore asserted at the PREPARED URL -- see
  `test_asof_survives_query_string_encoding_at_the_transport`.

Every test here is offline. The vendor transport is `mock_alpaca_client`, which
patches `acquisition.alpaca._AlpacaMarketDataClient` by dotted string. No test
sleeps for real, makes a network call, requires a real credential, or touches
any real data volume.

This file lands in 03.2-01 (Wave 0) carrying its fixture self-tests; 03.2-03 and
03.2-06 fill in the behavioural tests above. It is deliberately NOT an empty
placeholder: a pytest file with zero collected tests exits 5 ("no tests ran"),
which a later task's automated command reads as green.

# RESEARCH Assumption A8, decided here rather than left open: the intraday
# `date=` partition key is derived from the US/Eastern SESSION date, not from
# the naive-UTC date. Timestamp VALUES stay naive UTC -- unchanged, and
# consistent with Tiingo's and with every other timestamp in this codebase --
# and ONLY the derived key converts.
#
# A UTC-derived key files the last ~4 hours of every US session (20:00-24:00
# UTC) under the FOLLOWING day. A "give me one trading day" query is then wrong
# at BOTH edges, and it is wrong in the shape that reads as sparse data rather
# than as a bug: the close is missing and the previous session's tail is
# present. The boundary test and its negative control below are what make the
# conversion un-deletable -- a plain `dt.date()` truncation turns both red.
