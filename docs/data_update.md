# Daily data update

One script brings every shared store up to the latest bar, in order: the raw vendor downloads, the
Zarr stores, the factors and the factor risk model. It runs on its own schedule. The paper trading
does not update data; it waits until the update reports that the day is done.

## What it runs

`scripts/data_update/update.py` reads `config/data_update.yaml` and runs its stages in order under the data
root `--data-dir`. Each step is one action on one store folder (paths relative to the data root):

| action | what it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `sharadar` | `scripts/sharadar/update.py`: downloads every Sharadar table and updates `market/sharadar/` and `universe/sharadar/` |
| `fred` | downloads the FRED series from `start` (required), then updates the store in the named folder |
| `benchmarks` | `scripts/sharadar/price_return_benchmark.py --refresh` for the listed tickers (`market/benchmarks/`) |
| `update` | rebuilds the dataset of a store folder from its `component.json` and calls `update()` |
| `mirror` | appends a source dataset's new bars to a store that copies its variables (`quantlab.backtest.live.mirror_new_bars`) |
| `extend` | rebuilds a factor, or a factor risk model, from the folder's `component.json` and extends it to t |
| `run` | runs any script under the repository: `{script: ..., args: [...], writes: [...], reads: [...]}`; `{data_dir}` and `{download_dir}` in `args` are filled in (other braces are kept) |

Any other action is an error, in a run and in `--check`. A `sharadar`, `benchmarks` or `run` step
lists in `writes` the store folders, or folder prefixes ending in `/`, it writes (the shipped file:
`market/sharadar/` and `universe/sharadar/` for `sharadar`, `market/benchmarks/` for
`benchmarks`); `update`, `extend`, `mirror` and `fred` write their `store`. A `run` step may list
in `reads` the folders or prefixes it reads; the others' reads come from their components.
`--check` orders every step's reads against the later steps' writes.

A step with `allow_failure: true` that raises is recorded as failed and the run goes on; whether
the day is ready is still decided by the `ready` stores.

t is the last bar of the file's `calendar` store (`market/sharadar/sharadar_sep_1d`) once the
`raw` stage is done. Until every store in the file's `ready` list holds t, and t is newer than
`last_done_t` (the t of the last run that reached `done`, whatever states came after it), the raw
stage is retried every `--retry-minutes` (15) until `--retry-until` (08:30 New York time). A factor
is extended only by the store's owner (`Factor.owns_store`), never by a view pinned to some of its
outputs.

The shipped file updates what the us3000 paper trading reads, plus the base data: every Sharadar
table, the FRED 3-month T-bill rate, the price-return benchmarks, the Barra exposures, the us3000
membership, the us3000 alphas and the USE4 risk stores. The us3000 alphas read Sharadar SEP on
the membership's roster (`RosterDataset`, see the [dataset guide](dataset.md)), so the update keeps
no price copy cut to the roster: SEP is brought up by the raw stage and the membership by the
`universe` stage, both before the `factors` stage. WRDS data is not in the
daily update; run `scripts/wrds/*.py` when the vendor publishes.

```bash
cd ~/projects/quantlab2
export SHARADAR_API_KEY=<your-sharadar-key>
QUANTLAB_DATA_DIR=/data/quantlab taskset -c 64-114 .venv/bin/python scripts/data_update/update.py \
    --data-dir /data/quantlab --download-dir /data/quantlab/downloads
```

`--dry-run` prints the steps without running them; `--stage NAME` (repeatable) runs only those
stages, without the retry and without writing the status file. `--check` downloads and computes
nothing: it rebuilds every step's component, checks that `update` names a dataset, that `extend`
names a factor owning its store or a factor risk model, and that no step reads a store a later
step writes, that the first stage writes the `calendar` store and every `ready` store, and that a
`mirror` source is a dataset, then prints each problem and exits 1 if there is any. Run it after
editing the file.

## Store configs

A store the update rebuilds holds a `component.json` beside its `README.md`: the component's
`get_config()`, as JSON. `quantlab.core.store_folder.load_component(folder)` turns it back into the
dataset, factor or risk model with every nested component, so the update needs no recipe code.
`save_component(component, folder, readme=...)` writes it (and the README): it first checks that
the config rebuilds into an equal component, so a component held in memory is refused. A recipe
saves the components of the stores it defines; `python
examples/sharadar_us_equity/us3000_h1_mvo.py store-configs` saves the us3000 ones.

## The status file

When it starts (`running`) and when it finishes, the update writes `<data-dir>/update_status.json`
(not with `--dry-run` or `--stage`):

| field | value |
|-------|-------|
| `date` | the New York date of the run |
| `state` | `running`, `done`, `no_new_bar` (nothing new by the cut-off, as on a market holiday) or `failed` |
| `t` | the bar the stores were brought to |
| `last_done_t` | the t of the last run that reached `done` (this run's t when it is `done`); a bar is new only after it |
| `steps` | each step's action, store, result and seconds |
| `reason` | why it stopped, for `no_new_bar` and `failed`; when the raw stage gives up it also names the `allow_failure` steps that failed (e.g. `sharadar failed: ...`) |

`date`, `state`, `t` and `last_done_t` are the contract quantlab-ibkr's `scripts/live_daily.sh`
reads: it waits for `"state": "done"` with today's `date` before it runs the prediction job; a day
that never gets there holds. Change them only together with that script.

The exit status follows the final state: 0 `done`, 1 `failed`, 3 `no_new_bar` (normal on a
holiday, but not a done day). `--check` exits 1 when it finds a problem.

## Schedule

`scripts/data_update/update_daily.sh` is the cron entry. cron calls it every hour and it checks the time in
New York itself, so daylight-saving changes need no edit; at 06 ET on a weekday it runs the update,
with `SHARADAR_API_KEY` from `~/.config/quantlab/sharadar.env`, on NUMA Node 1, under a lock, and
logs to `<data-dir>/logs/data_update/<date>.log`:

```
0 * * * * $HOME/projects/quantlab2/scripts/data_update/update_daily.sh
```

`update_daily.sh now` runs it at once.

Each run ends with an e-mail in Chinese: the state and t of the status file in the subject, its
steps in the body, and the log's last lines when the update did not exit 0.
`scripts/notify/send_mail.py` sends it over SMTP with the settings in `~/.config/quantlab/mail.env`
(readable by the owner only); without them nothing is sent, and a failed send never fails the run.
The paper trading (quantlab-ibkr `live_daily.sh`) sends its own mails with the same script.

```bash
# ~/.config/quantlab/mail.env
QUANTLAB_SMTP_HOST=smtp.163.com          # default; port 465 (SSL) by default, 587 uses STARTTLS
QUANTLAB_SMTP_USER=<sending account>
QUANTLAB_SMTP_PASSWORD=<its SMTP authorisation code>
QUANTLAB_MAIL_TO=<recipients, comma separated>
```

## Add a store

1. Build the store in its folder (`<category>/<group>/<stem>/<stem>.zarr`) and save its component
   there: `save_component(factor, folder, readme="# my_factor\n...")`.
2. Add an `update` or `extend` step to `config/data_update.yaml`, after the steps that update its
   inputs. A new vendor script that takes `--data-dir` goes in as a `run` step.
3. Run `scripts/data_update/update.py --check`; it names any missing `component.json`, a factor
   that does not own its store, or a step placed before the step that writes its inputs.
