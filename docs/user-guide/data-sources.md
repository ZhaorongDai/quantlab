# Data sources

This page explains how quantlab gets market data onto your disk. It covers the
three vendors quantlab can download from, how to give it credentials, how to
start a download from the command line or from Python, where the files land,
how an interrupted download resumes, how vendor rate limits behave, how to
look at what is already downloaded without any
credentials, and how raw downloads become the `(timestamp, symbol)` panel the
rest of the pipeline reads. Read it before your first download. WRDS (CRSP daily
stock files and TAQ quotes) has enough of its own concepts that it has a
separate page, [WRDS: CRSP and TAQ](wrds.md).

The runnable companion to this page is `examples/inspect_data_sources.py`. It
needs no credentials or network access, and the output shown below comes from
it.

## Two tiers: raw files and the panel

Every download produces a *raw tier*: parquet files that hold the vendor's rows
more or less exactly as they arrived, plus a few small JSON bookkeeping files.
Nothing downstream reads the raw tier directly. A separate *conversion* step
turns it into a Zarr store holding an `xarray.Dataset` indexed by `timestamp`
and `symbol`. The project calls this a *panel*: one row per date, one column per
security, one variable per field (close, volume and so on). Factors, models and
backtests read panels, never raw files.

Keeping the two steps apart is deliberate. A market-wide backfill can take
hours, and converting it is a separate long job; each step can be interrupted
and resumed on its own, and you can re-convert with different settings without
downloading anything again. See [Datasets](datasets.md) for the panel side.

## The vendors

Each vendor is described once in `quantlab.registry` by a *source descriptor*,
which lists the environment variables holding its credentials and the
*capabilities* it serves. A capability is one `(market, frequency, data_type)`
combination, together with the dataset class that can convert it to a panel.

| Vendor | Serves | Credentials | Converts to a panel |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tiingo` | US equity daily bars (end-of-day prices with adjusted columns) | `TIINGO_API_KEY` | yes, `StockDataset` |
| `alpaca` | US equity daily and minute bars; tick-level quotes and trades | `APCA_API_KEY_ID`, `APCA_API_SECRET_KEY` | bars yes; quotes and trades no |
| `wrds` | CRSP daily stock data; TAQ national best bid and offer quotes | `WRDS_USERNAME` (password in `~/.pgpass`) | yes, `CrspStockDataset` and `NbboPanelDataset` |

Alpaca's quotes and trades are individually timestamped events on an irregular
time axis. No dense panel can represent them without inventing data, so they
stay in the raw tier, where you can query them with polars.

Binance crypto klines are handled differently: `SpotKlineDataset` converts
monthly CSV files you have already downloaded from Binance's public
bulk-download site. It needs no credentials, is not a registry source, and has
no download script.

### Listing sources in Python

`DataSourceRegistry.all()` returns every descriptor. Importing
`quantlab.registry` imports all vendor modules, so the list is always complete.

```python
from quantlab.registry import DataSourceRegistry, credential_status

for source in DataSourceRegistry.all():
    print(f"{source.vendor}: {source.display_name}")
    for cap in source.capabilities:
        converter = cap.dataset_cls.__name__ if cap.dataset_cls else "(raw only)"
        print(f"    market={cap.market} frequency={cap.frequency} "
              f"data_type={cap.data_type} -> {converter}")
    print(f"    credentials: {credential_status(source)}")
```

On a machine with no credentials set, this prints:

```text
alpaca: Alpaca Market Data
    market=us_equity frequency=1d data_type=bars -> StockDataset
    market=us_equity frequency=1m data_type=bars -> StockDataset
    market=us_equity frequency=tick data_type=quotes -> (raw only)
    market=us_equity frequency=tick data_type=trades -> (raw only)
    credentials: {'APCA_API_KEY_ID': False, 'APCA_API_SECRET_KEY': False}
tiingo: Tiingo EOD
    market=us_equity frequency=1d data_type=None -> StockDataset
    credentials: {'TIINGO_API_KEY': False}
wrds: WRDS (NYSE TAQ millisecond NBBO; CRSP Stock v2 daily)
    market=us_equity frequency=tick data_type=nbbo -> NbboPanelDataset
    market=us_equity frequency=1d data_type=crsp_daily -> CrspStockDataset
    credentials: {'WRDS_USERNAME': False}
```

`DataSourceRegistry.get("tiingo")` returns one descriptor, and
`source.supports("us_equity", "tick")` answers whether it serves a combination.
See the docstrings in `quantlab/registry.py` for the full interface.

## Credentials

Credentials are read from environment variables and nowhere else. No script
takes a key as an argument, because a key typed on the command line ends up in
your shell history, and no config field holds one, because configs are saved
as JSON beside model checkpoints. Keys are also removed from every error
message before it is logged or written to disk.

```bash
export TIINGO_API_KEY=...
export APCA_API_KEY_ID=...
export APCA_API_SECRET_KEY=...
export WRDS_USERNAME=...          # the WRDS password goes in ~/.pgpass, see wrds.md
```

`credential_status(source)` (shown above) and `is_configured(source)` tell you
whether the variables are set. They return booleans only and never read a value
into anything else. A variable set to the empty string counts as unset.

A credential is demanded only when a vendor client is constructed, which is the
moment a download starts. Everything else on this page (sizing a request,
inspecting files, converting raw files to a panel) works without one.

## Downloading from the command line

The download scripts live under `scripts/wrds/`, one per kind of data the WRDS
account serves. Each is a thin shell: it parses the few arguments that change
between runs, downloads the raw tier and converts it to Zarr in the same run.
Batch size, chunk granularity and concurrency come from the library defaults.
One script sits outside WRDS: `scripts/fama_french.py` downloads the
Fama-French three factors from Kenneth French's data library, which needs no
account, as the CSV `ResidualMomentumFF3` reads.

| Script | Downloads | Roster argument |
|---|---|---|
| `index.py` | An index's daily bars and its membership panel | `--index sp500\|nasdaq100` |
| `market.py` | Every CRSP security's daily bars and the listing panel | `--security-filter` preset |
| `etf.py` | One store per ETF | `--etf spy,qqq,name=PERMNO` |
| `nbbo.py` | TAQ NBBO quotes resampled into a bar panel on the PERMNO axis | `--permnos` or `--index` |

They share `--start` (required), `--end` (default today, clipped to the
vendor product's last date), `--refresh` (fetch forward from each symbol's
last downloaded date instead of backfilling the window), `--max-workers`
(parallel download threads, default 4), `--download-dir` (where the raw
files go) and `--zarr-dir` (where the Zarr stores go); the last two default
to the current directory. The rosters are *point-in-time*: an index roster
holds every security that belonged to the index at any time in the window,
including those since delisted, which keeps *survivorship bias* (a history
made only of companies that survived) out of the data.

```bash
uv run python scripts/wrds/index.py --index sp500 --start 2015-01-01
uv run python scripts/wrds/market.py --start 2024-01-01
uv run python scripts/wrds/etf.py --etf spy,qqq --start 1999-01-01
uv run python scripts/wrds/nbbo.py --permnos 14593,10107,83443 \
    --start 2024-01-24 --end 2024-01-25 --interval 1m
```

The scripts are described in [WRDS: CRSP and TAQ](wrds.md); run any of them
with `--help` for its complete flag list. Tiingo, Alpaca and Binance have
library interfaces only: their acquisition and dataset classes are driven from
Python through `quantlab.registry.run` and `quantlab.registry.convert`, as in
the next section.

## Downloading from Python

`quantlab.registry.run(descriptor, config)` runs a download in the current
process and returns an `AcquisitionResult`. The descriptor's `config_factory`
builds an `AcquisitionConfig` with the standard paths for that vendor. This
needs `TIINGO_API_KEY` and network access, so no output is shown:

```python
from quantlab.registry import DataSourceRegistry, run

source = DataSourceRegistry.get("tiingo")
config = source.config_factory(
    symbols=("AAPL", "MSFT"),
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2024-05-31",
    kwargs={"max_workers": 4},
)
result = run(source, config)
print(result.succeeded, result.failures, result.coverage)
```

`result.failures` maps each symbol that failed in this run to a message;
`result.cancelled` and `result.quota_aborted` say whether the run stopped
early. `run(..., refresh=True)` fetches each symbol forward from where it last
stopped instead of backfilling the whole window.

Per-run tuning lives in `config.kwargs`, so a run is fully described by its
config: `batch_size` (symbols per request), `max_workers` (concurrent
requests), `resume`, `progress`, the quota and rate-limit knobs below, and
vendor options such as Alpaca's `data_type`, `feed`, `adjustment` and
`page_limit`. Alpaca bars are requested unadjusted (`adjustment="raw"`) unless
you say otherwise. See the docstrings of `quantlab.base.acquisition.Acquisition`
and each vendor class for details.

### Progress events

By default a download draws a progress bar on stderr. To follow it from your
own code, pass a `reporter`. `CallbackProgressReporter` calls a function with
each `ProgressEvent`; `NullProgressReporter` discards them. The example script
collects the events of a three-symbol download:

```python
from quantlab.base.progress import CallbackProgressReporter

events = []
result = run(source, config, reporter=CallbackProgressReporter(events.append))
for event in events:
    print(f"    event {event.kind:<16} {event.completed}/{event.total}")
```

```text
    event coverage         3/3
    event run_started      0/3
    event batch_completed  1/3
    event batch_completed  2/3
    event batch_completed  3/3
    event run_finished     3/3
```

`coverage` carries counts of symbols already on disk in `event.detail`, and
`quota_exhausted` and `cancelled` mark early stops. The full list is
`quantlab.base.progress.EVENT_KINDS`. An exception raised inside a reporter is
logged and ignored, so a bug in your progress display cannot end a long
download.

### Cancelling

A reporter cannot stop a run; a `CancelToken` can. Pass one as `cancel=` and
call `token.cancel()` from any thread. The run stops at the next batch
boundary, keeps every completed batch on disk, and a later run resumes from
there. In the example, the token is set as soon as the first batch lands:

```python
from quantlab.base.progress import CallbackProgressReporter, CancelToken

token = CancelToken()

def stop_after_first_batch(event):
    if event.kind == "batch_completed":
        token.cancel()

result = run(source, wider_config,
             reporter=CallbackProgressReporter(stop_after_first_batch),
             cancel=token)
print("cancelled:", result.cancelled, "newly completed:", result.succeeded)
```

```text
cancelled: True newly completed: ('AMD',)
```

## Where files land

The scripts write where you point them: raw files under `--download-dir` and
Zarr stores under `--zarr-dir`, both defaulting to the current directory. In
the library, paths derive from one *data root*: the `QUANTLAB_DATA_DIR`
environment variable, else a `data/` directory at the top of the repository.
In Python, call `quantlab.config.set_data_root(path)` before building any
config, because configs record their paths when they are created.

Beneath the root, raw downloads live under `downloads/{market}/{frequency}/`
and panels under `data/{market}/{frequency}/`. After the example's Tiingo-layout
download the tree looks like this:

```text
<root>/downloads/us_equity/1d/nasdaq_data/
    tiingo/month=2024-01/part-6f28d5ecbc46ad74-00000.pqt   raw shards
    tiingo/month=2024-02/...
    _watermarks/tiingo/AAPL.json                           one sidecar per symbol
    _watermarks/tiingo/_failures.json                      failure manifest
    _watermarks/tiingo/_pages/6f28d5ecbc46ad74.pages.json  page ledgers
<root>/data/us_equity/1d/stock.zarr                        the converted panel
```

Each parquet file is a *shard*: the rows of one request page for one partition.
Directories named `key=value` form a *hive* layout, so a reader can skip whole
months (daily data), days (minute data) or data-type, day and symbol
directories (tick data) without opening them. The bookkeeping lives in a
sibling `_watermarks/` directory rather than inside the raw tree, because a
polars directory scan reads every file under the root it is given.

Each vendor has its own directory, so two vendors' rows never mix. The default
locations are:

| Download | Raw tier | Panel |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/wrds/index.py` | `<download-dir>/wrds` | `<zarr-dir>/wrds_crsp_{sp500,nasdaq100}_1d.zarr` and `_membership.zarr` |
| `scripts/wrds/market.py` | `<download-dir>/wrds` | `<zarr-dir>/wrds_crsp_market_1d.zarr` and `_membership.zarr` |
| `scripts/wrds/etf.py` | `<download-dir>/wrds` | `<zarr-dir>/wrds_crsp_{name}_1d.zarr` |
| `scripts/wrds/nbbo.py` | `<download-dir>/wrds` | `<zarr-dir>/wrds_nbbo_{interval}_{HHMM-HHMM}.zarr` |
| `scripts/fama_french.py` | `<download-dir>/fama_french/ff3_{daily,monthly}.csv` | none: the CSV is read by `ResidualMomentumFF3` |
| Tiingo (library) | `downloads/us_equity/1d/nasdaq_data/tiingo` | `data/us_equity/1d/stock.zarr` |
| Alpaca (library) | `downloads/us_equity/{1d,1m,tick}/nasdaq_data/alpaca` | `data/us_equity/{1d,1m}/stock_alpaca.zarr` |

Given the same `--download-dir`, the three CRSP scripts share one raw tier,
one set of watermarks and one reference directory (`<download-dir>/_reference`).
Point `nbbo.py` at that directory too and it reuses the reference tables,
which it needs in both roster forms to map tickers to PERMNOs.

## Resuming an interrupted download

You resume a download by running the same command again. Nothing else is
needed, because the state that drives resumption lives on disk.

A *watermark* is a small JSON sidecar per symbol, for example
`{"last_date": "2024-03-29", "start_date": "2024-01-01"}`, written after the
symbol's batch completes. Before fetching anything, a run compares every
requested symbol's sidecar with the requested window and skips the symbols
already covered. Running the example's first download a second time fetches
nothing:

```text
coverage: {'requested': 3, 'pending': 0, 'skipped': 3, 'covered': 3, 'widened': 0, 'legacy': 0, 'no_data': 0}
```

The counts mean: `covered`, already downloaded over the window; `widened`,
downloaded but starting later than the new `start_date`, so fetched again;
`legacy`, a sidecar from an older version that records no start date;
`no_data`, the vendor was asked about this window and returned nothing, which
is recorded so the same window is not asked again (a longer window still is);
`pending`, what this run will fetch.

Vendors that split one request into several pages (Alpaca, and WRDS, where a
page is one trading day or one calendar year) also keep a *page ledger* per
batch under `_pages/`. It records which pages have landed and the token for the
next one, so an interrupted batch resumes at its next page rather than starting
over. Shard names are deterministic, so a page fetched twice overwrites itself
instead of duplicating rows.

Symbols that fail are listed with the reason in `_failures.json`. A failure in
one batch never stops the others. A failed symbol has no watermark, so the next
run tries it again. The manifest accumulates across runs; read it with
`SourceInspector.failures` (below).

Two situations need a deliberate choice. `download()` (the default) fills in
the requested window, while `--refresh` / `refresh()` starts each symbol from
its own last date and never widens the start. And sidecars written by older
versions of quantlab may lack a start date; by default they are skipped with a
warning on every run. `acquisition.stamp_watermarks("2016-01-01")` records the
start you know they were fetched from, issuing no requests, and
`kwargs["legacy_watermarks"] = "refetch"` treats them as not covered instead.

## Rate limits and quotas

Vendors limit how fast you can ask, and they do not all mean the same thing by
it, so each vendor class decides how to read a refusal.

Tiingo answers HTTP 429 when the account's hourly request allocation is spent.
That affects every remaining symbol, so the run stops sending requests at once
(the progress bar reads `QUOTA EXHAUSTED -- draining, not fetching`),
`result.quota_aborted` is true, and a later run resumes. To have the run wait
instead, set `kwargs["wait_for_quota"] = True`: the run then sleeps
`quota_wait_seconds` (default 3600) and retries, at most `quota_max_waits`
times (default 3).

Alpaca answers 429 when a per-minute ceiling is hit, which clears in seconds.
The batch that hit it waits `rate_limit_backoff_seconds` (default 5) and
retries, up to `rate_limit_max_retries` times (default 6), before it is
recorded as failed for the next run. The free plan allows about 200 historical
requests per minute and the paid plan about 10,000; at 200 per minute a
market-wide daily backfill takes about 8 minutes but a market-wide minute-bar
backfill takes about 50 hours.

WRDS has no request quota. Its limits are disk space and the handful of
connections an account may hold, which is why a WRDS run pools at most six
connections and stops instead of reconnecting (see [WRDS](wrds.md)). Nothing estimates a download's size before
it runs, so scope a request by roster and window.

## Inspecting what is on disk

`SourceInspector` answers questions about a source's local files. It builds no
vendor client, so it needs no credentials and makes no network request. Each
method takes the config that locates the data.

```python
from quantlab.acquisition._support.inspector import SourceInspector

inspector = SourceInspector()
inspector.coverage(acq_config)            # what a download would skip or fetch
inspector.failures(acq_config)            # {symbol: reason} across all runs
inspector.inventory(acq_config, ds_config)  # shard, sidecar and store figures
inspector.browse_raw(ds_config, ["AAPL"], "2024-01-01", "2024-01-04")  # polars LazyFrame
inspector.browse_zarr(ds_config, ["AAPL"], "2024-01-02", "2024-01-04") # xarray Dataset
```

After the example's cancelled run, `coverage` reports that two of the six
requested symbols are still to fetch, and `inventory` summarises the raw tier:

```text
{'requested': 6, 'pending': 2, 'skipped': 4, 'covered': 4, 'widened': 0, 'legacy': 0, 'no_data': 0}
    root: <root>/downloads/us_equity/1d/nasdaq_data/tiingo
    shards: 12
    symbols_with_watermark: 4
    coverage_start: 2024-01-01
    coverage_last_date: 2024-03-29
    failures: 0
```

`browse_raw` and `browse_zarr` require a symbol list and a date window, so
what they return is always narrow. `browse_zarr` raises for a symbol the store
does not hold rather than returning an empty column, because an empty column
would look like a security with no history.

## Converting raw downloads into a panel

The WRDS scripts convert after downloading with the library defaults; for
other options call `quantlab.registry.convert(descriptor, dataset_config)` in
Python. Conversion
reads only local files, so it needs no credentials. In the example it converts
the raw tier written above:

```python
from quantlab.config import stock_kline_config
from quantlab.registry import DataSourceRegistry, convert

ds_config = stock_kline_config(start_date="2024-01-01", end_date="2024-03-29",
                               symbols=("AAPL", "AMD", "MSFT", "NVDA"))
result = convert(DataSourceRegistry.get("tiingo"), ds_config, granularity="month")
print(result.windows_written, result.windows_planned, result.rows_written)
```

```text
    windows written: 3/3, rows: 65, store: <root>/data/us_equity/1d/stock.zarr
    dims: {'timestamp': 65, 'symbol': 4}
```

The conversion runs one time window at a time (`granularity`: `year` by
default, down to `day` or `hour`) and records each finished window,
so an interrupted or cancelled conversion resumes at the first unwritten
window. It accepts `reporter=` and `cancel=` like `run()`. Nothing checks that a
window fits in memory, so choose a finer granularity for a large roster or for
minute data.

When the roster has grown since the store was built (a new listing between two
refreshes), `on_new_listing` decides what happens: `refuse` (the default)
stops and leaves the store untouched; `widen` adds the new symbols with empty
history, which is right for a genuine new listing; `rebuild` rebuilds every
window from the raw tier, which is right when a symbol already had history.
[Datasets](datasets.md) covers stores, backends and chunked conversion in
detail.
