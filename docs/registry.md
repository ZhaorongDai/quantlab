# Data source registry

English | [简体中文](zh-CN/registry.md)

The registry is the catalogue of every place quantlab can download market data from. Each source (Alpaca, Tiingo, WRDS) is described once: which environment variables hold its credentials and which market, frequency and data type it serves. Two functions, `run()` and `convert()`, download a raw tier and convert it to Zarr from Python without naming a vendor class, and `SourceInspector` reports what is already on disk without needing any credential.

## Prerequisites

Install the project with `uv sync`. Browsing the catalogue and inspecting local files needs no credential. Downloading needs the variables below to be set in the environment of the process that calls `run()`.

| Vendor | Environment variables | Serves |
|---|---|---|
| `alpaca` | `APCA_API_KEY_ID`, `APCA_API_SECRET_KEY` | US equity 1d and 1m bars; tick quotes and trades |
| `tiingo` | `TIINGO_API_KEY` | US equity daily bars |
| `wrds` | `WRDS_USERNAME` (password in `~/.pgpass`) | TAQ NBBO quotes; CRSP daily bars |

The sessions in this guide leave out the log lines that quantlab writes to stderr through `loguru`.

## The basics

### Sources and capabilities

`DataSourceRegistry.all()` returns one `SourceDescriptor` per vendor, sorted by vendor name. A descriptor holds the display name, the environment variable names, the default acquisition class and a tuple of `Capability` rows. A capability is one combination of market, frequency and data type that the vendor serves; data type is `None` when the vendor draws no such distinction.

```python
>>> from quantlab.registry import DataSourceRegistry
>>> [d.vendor for d in DataSourceRegistry.all()]
['alpaca', 'tiingo', 'wrds']
>>> wrds = DataSourceRegistry.get("wrds")
>>> wrds.display_name
'WRDS (NYSE TAQ millisecond NBBO; CRSP Stock v2 daily)'
>>> for c in wrds.capabilities: print(c.market, c.frequency, c.data_type, c.earliest_available)
us_equity tick nbbo 2003-09-10
us_equity 1d crsp_daily 1925-12-31
```

One WRDS account serves two products, so the two capability rows name different acquisition classes. `earliest_available` is advisory and is never checked.

### Credentials

A descriptor stores environment variable names, never values. `credential_status()` returns a dict of `{name: is_set}` and `is_configured()` returns whether every variable is set and non-empty. Neither function returns, logs or masks a value.

```python
>>> import os
>>> from quantlab.registry import credential_status, is_configured
>>> credential_status(wrds)
{'WRDS_USERNAME': False}
>>> is_configured(wrds)
False
>>> os.environ["WRDS_USERNAME"] = "my_login"
>>> credential_status(wrds), is_configured(wrds)
({'WRDS_USERNAME': True}, True)
```

### Asking what serves a request

`supports()` tells whether a source serves a `(market, frequency, data_type)` request. `capabilities_for()` returns the matching rows, and `data_type=None` matches any data type. `acquisition_cls_for()` returns the class that would download the request.

```python
>>> wrds.supports("us_equity", "tick", "nbbo")
True
>>> wrds.supports("us_equity", "1m")
False
>>> alpaca = DataSourceRegistry.get("alpaca")
>>> [c.data_type for c in alpaca.capabilities_for("us_equity", "tick")]
['quotes', 'trades']
>>> wrds.acquisition_cls_for("us_equity", "1d").__name__
'WrdsCrspDailyAcquisition'
>>> wrds.acquisition_cls_for("us_equity", "tick", "nbbo").__name__
'WrdsTaqNbboAcquisition'
```

If several matching rows name different classes, `acquisition_cls_for()` raises `ValueError` and asks for `data_type`; it never picks one.

### Download, then convert

`run(source, config)` downloads a window into the raw tier (parquet shards plus one small JSON watermark file per symbol) and returns an `AcquisitionResult`. `convert(source, dataset_config)` reads the raw tier and writes the Zarr store; it needs no credential and no network. The two calls are separate on purpose. A configuration for a source comes from its `config_factory`:

```python
from quantlab.registry import DataSourceRegistry, run, convert

source = DataSourceRegistry.get("tiingo")            # needs TIINGO_API_KEY
config = source.config_factory(
    symbols=("AAPL", "MSFT"), start_date="2024-01-02", end_date="2024-05-31"
)
result = run(source, config)                          # raw parquet on disk
result.failures                                       # {symbol: reason} for this run
```

Raw paths derive from the data root, which is `QUANTLAB_DATA_DIR` when set and the `data/` directory of the repository otherwise.

### Progress and cancellation

`run()` and `convert()` accept a `reporter` and a `cancel` argument. A reporter receives one `ProgressEvent` per step; the default draws a tqdm bar on stderr, `NullProgressReporter` discards events and `CallbackProgressReporter(fn)` calls `fn(event)`. Acquisition emits `coverage`, `run_started`, `batch_completed`, `quota_exhausted`, `cancelled` and `run_finished`. Conversion emits `conversion_started`, `window_written`, `window_skipped`, `cancelled` and `conversion_finished`. A reporter cannot stop a run. Stopping goes through a `CancelToken`, which the loop checks between batches (download) or windows (conversion). Finished batches stay on disk, so the next call resumes where the previous one stopped.

## Common tasks

The sessions below use a small offline source called `demo`. Save the listing under Extending as `demo_source.py` in the working directory to follow along; nothing here needs a credential or the network.

### Download a window and watch progress

A `CallbackProgressReporter` collects the events. Each event carries `completed` and `total` counts and the symbols of the batch. The demo config uses one symbol per batch.

```python
>>> import tempfile
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> from quantlab.registry import DataSourceRegistry, run, convert
>>> import demo_source
>>> root = Path(tempfile.mkdtemp())
>>> acq_cfg, ds_cfg = demo_source.make_configs(root)
>>> from quantlab.base.progress import CallbackProgressReporter
>>> events = []
>>> result = run(demo_source.DEMO, acq_cfg, reporter=CallbackProgressReporter(events.append))
>>> for e in events: print(e.kind, e.completed, e.total, e.symbols)
coverage 3 3 ()
run_started 0 3 ()
batch_completed 1 3 ('AAPL',)
batch_completed 2 3 ('MSFT',)
batch_completed 3 3 ('NVDA',)
run_finished 3 3 ()
>>> result.succeeded, result.failures
(('AAPL', 'MSFT', 'NVDA'), {})
```

### Stop a run and resume it

Setting a `CancelToken` from the callback stops the run at the next batch boundary. The result reports `cancelled=True` and only the symbols that finished. Calling `run()` again with the same config skips them.

```python
>>> from quantlab.base.progress import CancelToken
>>> token = CancelToken()
>>> def stop_after_first(event):
...     if event.kind == "batch_completed" and event.completed == 1:
...         token.cancel()
>>> acq_cfg2, _ = demo_source.make_configs(root / "second")
>>> first = run(demo_source.DEMO, acq_cfg2, reporter=CallbackProgressReporter(stop_after_first), cancel=token)
>>> first.cancelled, first.succeeded
(True, ('AAPL',))
>>> second = run(demo_source.DEMO, acq_cfg2)
>>> second.cancelled, second.succeeded
(False, ('MSFT', 'NVDA'))
```

The second call downloaded only the two remaining symbols. `succeeded` lists the symbols this call fetched; the whole roster is covered, as `coverage["covered"]` and the inspector show.

### See what is on disk without credentials

`SourceInspector` answers from local files. It imports no vendor client, so it works on a machine that has no key. `coverage()` classifies the requested symbols against the config's window, `failures()` reads the failure manifest that accumulates across runs, and `inventory()` counts shards, bytes and the covered date span. Passing a `DatasetConfig` to `inventory()` adds the Zarr store.

```python
>>> from quantlab.acquisition._support.inspector import SourceInspector
>>> inspector = SourceInspector()
>>> inspector.coverage(acq_cfg)
{'requested': 3, 'pending': 0, 'skipped': 3, 'covered': 3, 'widened': 0, 'legacy': 0, 'no_data': 0}
>>> inspector.failures(acq_cfg)
{}
>>> raw = inspector.inventory(acq_cfg)["raw"]
>>> raw["shards"], raw["symbols_with_watermark"], raw["coverage_start"], raw["coverage_last_date"]
(3, 3, '2024-01-02', '2024-01-05')
>>> inspector.inventory(acq_cfg, ds_cfg)["zarr"]["exists"]
False
```

`browse_raw()` returns a lazy polars frame narrowed to the given symbols and dates, sorted by `(timestamp, symbol)`:

```python
>>> inspector.browse_raw(ds_cfg, ["AAPL"], "2024-01-02", "2024-01-03").select("timestamp", "symbol", "close").collect()
shape: (2, 3)
┌─────────────────────┬────────┬───────┐
│ timestamp           ┆ symbol ┆ close │
│ ---                 ┆ ---    ┆ ---   │
│ datetime[ns]        ┆ str    ┆ f64   │
╞═════════════════════╪════════╪═══════╡
│ 2024-01-02 00:00:00 ┆ AAPL   ┆ 104.0 │
│ 2024-01-03 00:00:00 ┆ AAPL   ┆ 104.0 │
└─────────────────────┴────────┴───────┘
```

### Convert a raw tier to Zarr

`convert()` looks up the capability for the dataset config's market and frequency and runs the chunked conversion of its dataset class. The result records how many windows were written. A second call over the same config finds every window in the chunk ledger and writes nothing.

```python
>>> conversion = convert(demo_source.DEMO, ds_cfg)
>>> conversion.windows_written, conversion.rows_written, conversion.pinned_symbols
(1, 4, 3)
>>> inspector.inventory(acq_cfg, ds_cfg)["zarr"]["dims"]
{'timestamp': 4, 'symbol': 3}
>>> view = inspector.browse_zarr(ds_cfg, ["AAPL", "MSFT"], "2024-01-02", "2024-01-03")
>>> dict(view.sizes)
{'timestamp': 2, 'symbol': 2}
>>> second_conversion = convert(demo_source.DEMO, ds_cfg)
>>> second_conversion.windows_written, second_conversion.windows_skipped
(0, 1)
```

`granularity` sets the window size (`"year"` by default) and `on_new_listing` says what to do with a symbol that is not on the store's axis. See the chunking guide for both.

### Find out why a symbol failed

A failure in one batch does not raise. It is recorded in `result.failures` as `{symbol: message}` and in the on-disk failure manifest, and the run continues. The messages have credential values removed. The session below points the demo descriptor at an acquisition class that asks for a column it does not produce; `dataclasses.replace` builds a variant descriptor without registering it.

```python
>>> import dataclasses
>>> class BrokenAcquisition(demo_source.DemoAcquisition):
...     RAW_COLUMNS = (*demo_source.DemoAcquisition.RAW_COLUMNS, "bid")
>>> broken = dataclasses.replace(demo_source.DEMO, acquisition_cls=BrokenAcquisition)
>>> bad_cfg, _ = demo_source.make_configs(root / "broken", symbols=("AAPL",))
>>> bad = run(broken, bad_cfg)
>>> bad.succeeded, list(bad.failures)
((), ['AAPL'])
>>> bad.failures["AAPL"].split(";")[0]
'ColumnNotFoundError: unable to find column "bid"'
```

## Extending

A new source is one `SourceDescriptor` passed to `register_source()`, written next to the `Acquisition` subclass it describes. The subclass needs a `VENDOR` token, a `RAW_COLUMNS` tuple and a `_fetch_page()` method that returns `(DataFrame, next_page_token)`; a `None` token means the last page. This is the complete `demo_source.py` used above. It fabricates one flat bar per symbol per day and writes daily-bar columns, so the existing `StockDataset` converts it.

```python
"""A tiny offline data source that shows the whole registration."""

import functools
import tempfile
from datetime import datetime

            )

        return pl.concat(frames), None  # None: this was the last page


DEMO = register_source(
    SourceDescriptor(
        vendor="demo",
        display_name="Demo Vendor",
        acquisition_cls=DemoAcquisition,
        config_factory=functools.partial(stock_acquisition_config, vendor="demo"),
        capabilities=(
            Capability(market="us_equity", frequency="1d", dataset_cls=StockDataset),
        ),
        required_env=("DEMO_API_KEY",),
    )
)


def make_configs(root: Path, symbols=("AAPL", "MSFT", "NVDA")):
    """Return an AcquisitionConfig and the DatasetConfig that reads its output."""
    acquisition = AcquisitionConfig(
        market="us_equity", frequency="1d", vendor="demo",
        raw_data_dir_path=str(root / "raw" / "demo"),
        watermark_path=str(root / "watermarks" / "demo"),
        symbols=symbols, start_date="2024-01-02", end_date="2024-01-05",
        kwargs={"batch_size": 1, "max_workers": 1},
    )
    dataset = DatasetConfig(
        raw_data_dir_path=acquisition.raw_data_dir_path,

        start_date="2024-01-02", end_date="2024-01-05",
    )
    return acquisition, dataset
```

The descriptor lists one `Capability` per combination the vendor serves. `dataset_cls` names the dataset that converts the raw tier; leave it `None` for a capability that has no dense panel form, and `convert()` will refuse it. A capability may also carry its own `acquisition_cls` and `config_factory`, which is how one WRDS account serves two products. Registration must happen before anyone asks the registry, so a source outside the repository has to be imported first. For a source inside the repository, add its module to the import lines at the bottom of `quantlab/registry.py`.

```python
>>> [d.vendor for d in DataSourceRegistry.all()]
['alpaca', 'demo', 'tiingo', 'wrds']
>>> DataSourceRegistry.get("demo").supports("us_equity", "1d")
True
>>> from quantlab.registry import is_configured
>>> is_configured(demo_source.DEMO)
False
```

`is_configured()` reports the missing `DEMO_API_KEY`, yet `run()` worked above. The demo class never reads the variable. A vendor class that needs a key reads it in its constructor and raises when it is absent.

## Notes

`run()` constructs the acquisition class, and that is the first point where a credential is required. A missing variable raises `RuntimeError` before any request is made:

```python
>>> tiingo = DataSourceRegistry.get("tiingo")
>>> tiingo_cfg = tiingo.config_factory(symbols=("AAPL",), start_date="2024-01-02", end_date="2024-01-05")
>>> run(tiingo, tiingo_cfg)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
RuntimeError: TIINGO_API_KEY environment variable is not set. Export it before running acquisition (see Tiingo dashboard for your key).
```

For WRDS the same call raises `RuntimeError: WRDS_USERNAME environment variable must be set to your WRDS username. ...`; set the variable and put the password in `~/.pgpass` (see the WRDS TAQ guide).

`register_source()` allows one descriptor per vendor. A second registration of the same vendor raises `ValueError: vendor 'demo' is already registered ('Demo Vendor'). ...`; add another `Capability` to the existing descriptor instead. It also refuses a descriptor with an empty `capabilities` tuple.

`DataSourceRegistry.get()` raises `ValueError: No data source is registered for vendor 'bloomberg'. Registered vendors: ['alpaca', 'tiingo', 'wrds']. ...` for an unknown token, and the same happens for a vendor whose module was never imported.

`convert()` has no memory guard. It raises `ValueError` when the source serves no such capability (the message lists what it does serve), when several capabilities match with different conversion targets, and when the capability has no `dataset_cls`. Alpaca tick quotes and trades are stored raw on an irregular event axis and are examples of the last case:

```python
>>> from quantlab.base.config import DatasetConfig
>>> tick_cfg = DatasetConfig(raw_data_dir_path="data/alpaca", zarr_file_path="data/out.zarr",
...     catalog_path="data/catalog", market="us_equity", frequency="tick", vendor="alpaca",
...     start_date="2024-01-01", end_date="2024-01-31")
>>> convert(alpaca, tick_cfg, data_type="quotes")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
ValueError: Alpaca Market Data: no raw-to-Zarr conversion exists for ('us_equity', 'tick', 'quotes'). This capability's raw tier is a stream of individually-timestamped events on an irregular event axis, ...
```

The raw parquet shards of such a capability are the deliverable and can be read with polars directly.

`browse_raw()` and `browse_zarr()` require a non-empty symbol list and a date window, and raise `ValueError` for an empty list. `browse_zarr()` also raises `ValueError` for a symbol the store does not carry (`... does not carry ['ZZZ'] (requested ['ZZZ']). The store carries 3 symbol(s). ...`) instead of returning a column of NaN. On a CRSP store the symbol axis holds PERMNO integers, and the message says so.

Descriptors hold no base URL or host, and `SourceInspector` imports no vendor module. The registry import pulls in every vendor module, so `import quantlab.registry` is slower than importing the inspector alone.
