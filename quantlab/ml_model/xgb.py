"""XGBoost regression head for the tree-model layer.

``XGBoostRegressor`` is an ``MLModel`` (the numpy-based model base class in
``quantlab.base.model``). It trains an XGBoost ``Booster`` with ``xgb.train``
on the flattened ``(num_times * num_symbols, num_features)`` rows of the
factor panel and predicts future returns as ``[num_times, num_symbols,
num_labels]``. The Booster is fit on a pooled concordance-correlation loss
(``pooled_ccc_loss``) through the custom objective ``ccc_objective``, early
stopping uses xgboost's native callback on the validation RMSE, and
per-factor feature importance is recorded to Weights and Biases after
training.

The module is named ``xgb.py`` rather than ``xgboost.py`` so it does not
shadow the ``xgboost`` package inside this package.

    """Return ``1 - ccc``, the pooled concordance correlation loss.

    ``ccc = 2 * cov / (var_pred + var_true + (mu_pred - mu_true)^2)`` with
    population moments (``ddof=0``). Both inputs are flattened and scored as
    one pool, without any per-timestamp grouping, so the loss also rewards
    predicting the market-wide move of each day and penalises a correctly
    shrunk prediction whose variance is below the label's.

    A CCC of 1 means perfect agreement, 0 no agreement and -1 perfect
    inverse agreement, so the loss ranges from 0 (best) to 2 (worst).

    Only positions where both inputs are finite are used. When no such
    position remains, or the denominator is exactly zero, the loss ``1.0``
    (no agreement) is returned rather than NaN, so that early stopping can
    still compare rounds.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array_like

    the loss is ``L = 1 - ccc = mse / D``, whose derivative with respect to

    Both gradient and hessian are multiplied by ``n``, which leaves the

    turns negative when ``ccc < 0``, so the positive constant ``2 / D`` (the
    curvature of the numerator ``mse`` with ``D`` held fixed) is used instead.

    Each label column is its own pooled loss, so a multi-label DMatrix

class XGBoostRegressor(MLModel):
    """Predict future returns with an XGBoost Booster.

    Training flattens the ``[T, S, F]`` features and ``[T, S, L]`` labels to
    rows, drops every row with a non-finite label, converts infinite feature
    values to NaN (which xgboost treats as missing) and calls ``xgb.train``.
    Each label is one output of a multi-output regression; headline metrics
    are computed on the primary label, index 0.

    The training objective is the pooled CCC loss ``1 - ccc`` (see
    ``ccc_objective``), applied to every label column on its own. Unless
    ``base_score`` is given, the Booster starts from the mean of the
    finite training labels (written to the run summary as ``base_score``)
    instead of xgboost's ``0.5``, because the CCC
    gradient barely corrects a constant offset while ``ccc`` is near zero.
    Setting ``objective`` in the hyperparameters switches back to that
    built-in xgboost objective.

    Hyperparameters come from ``config.hyperparameters``. ``num_boost_round``
    (default 1000) is taken out separately; every other key overrides the
    matching entry of ``DEFAULT_PARAMS``, and ``seed`` defaults to
    ``config.random_seed``. scikit-learn style aliases such as
    ``learning_rate`` or ``n_estimators`` are rewritten to the native names
    first; giving both an alias and its native name raises ``ValueError``.
    The user's dict is never modified, and the parameters actually used are
    recorded under ``resolved_hyperparameters`` in the checkpoint's
    ``config.json`` and in the run config.

    With ``config.early_stopping`` set and a validation segment that has at
    least one finite-label row, ``xgb.callback.EarlyStopping`` watches the
    validation ``rmse``; ``rmse`` is appended to a user ``eval_metric`` that
    lacks it. Every other metric, and the ``ccc_loss`` curve of the training
    objective, is logged only. Patience counts boosting rounds.
    ``save_best=True`` means the returned Booster is already truncated to
    ``best_iteration + 1`` trees, so the ``.joblib`` checkpoint is the best
    model, and ``best_iteration`` and ``best_score`` (an RMSE) are written to
    the run summary. Without a usable validation
    segment a warning is logged and all rounds are trained.

    After training, per-factor importance (``weight``, ``gain`` and
    ``total_gain``) is written to the run summary as
    ``importance_{type}/{factor}`` and logged as a sorted table plus a
    top-30 bar chart. This is best effort: a Booster that cannot report an
    importance type only logs a warning, and the checkpoint is never lost
    because of it.

    ``train_cv`` (rolling walk-forward cross-validation) is inherited. Each
    fold does its own native early stopping and writes its own ``.joblib``.
    With ``parallel=True`` the folds run on threads while xgboost itself uses
    every core, so set ``nthread`` in the hyperparameters to roughly
    ``os.cpu_count() // njobs`` to avoid oversubscribing the CPU. The value
    is passed through unchanged.
