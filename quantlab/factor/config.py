"""The configs of the factor layer.

A factor is constructed from one of these and exposes it as ``self.config``. They
are frozen; the factor's config setter normalises the config it is given into a
new one (dates, factor names, the ``name`` field the factor is rebuilt from; see
``quantlab.core.component``). A factor's ``dataset`` (a market-feature
factor's ``series``, a neutralized factor's ``factor``) is declared with
``component()`` and written as its own config.
