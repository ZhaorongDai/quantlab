"""Alpha101 factor sets computed with the KunQuant backend.

"101 Formulaic Alphas" (Kakushadze, 2016) is a public list of 101 short
trading-signal formulas built from open, high, low, close, volume and VWAP.
KunQuant, the library this project uses for most factor computation, ships
them as its ``Alpha101`` library. KunQuant compiles a factor formula, written
as a graph of operators, to native code and runs it over a whole
``(timestamp, symbol)`` panel at once.

Two ``FactorKunQuant`` subclasses expose the library. They differ in which
input columns they read and in how the outputs are normalized:
``Alpha101SpotKline`` works on crypto spot klines (candlestick bars) and
z-scores every output along time, while ``Alpha101Stock`` works on adjusted
US-equity bars and z-scores every output across symbols.

class Alpha101SpotKline(TimeSeriesZScoredFactor):
    """Alpha101 factors over crypto spot klines, z-scored along time.

    Reads the lowercase ``open``, ``high``, ``low``, ``close``, ``volume``
    and ``amount`` (traded value in quote currency) columns of the spot kline
    dataset. Every output is wrapped in ``WindowedZScore`` over
    ``zscore_window`` bars (``kwargs["zscore_window"]``, default 20), which
    standardizes each symbol against its own trailing window. That time-series normalization suits the strategies
    spot data is traded with here, which follow one asset over time. The
    US-equity sibling ``Alpha101Stock`` z-scores across symbols instead,
    because it serves cross-sectional strategies that compare symbols on the
    same bar. The two classes are intentionally different.

    Parameters
    ----------
    factor_config : FactorConfig
        The KunQuant factor config. ``kwargs["zscore_window"]`` sets the
        z-score window. ``warmup_bars`` must cover the longest alpha
        lookback plus ``zscore_window - 1`` bars for the first requested bar
        to be fully normalized. ``data_columns`` lists the six input
        columns above, and ``factor_names`` selects which alphas to compute
        (all 101 when unset).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> factor = Alpha101SpotKline(FactorConfig(
    ...     warmup_bars=60, dataset=dataset, mode="batch",
    ...     data_columns=["open", "high", "low", "close", "volume", "amount"],

class Alpha101Stock(FactorKunQuant):
    """Alpha101 factors over adjusted US-equity bars, z-scored across symbols.

    Reads ``adjOpen``, ``adjHigh``, ``adjLow``, ``adjClose`` and
    ``adjVolume``, the split- and dividend-adjusted series. Every output is
    wrapped in ``CrossSectionalZScore``: US equities are traded here with
    cross-sectional strategies, so each alpha is standardized across the
    symbols of the same bar, never along a symbol's own history. The graphs
    come from ``quantlab.factor._support.kunquant_alpha101`` and are built
    inside ``missing_bars_only``: a symbol with no bar that day is NaN in
    every operator, so it stays out of the ranks and the z-score, and every
    other value is KunQuant's, including the 0 its formulas give a value
    that is undefined on real data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    factor_config : FactorConfig
        The KunQuant factor config. ``data_columns`` lists the five
        adjusted columns above and ``factor_names`` selects which alphas to
        compute (all 101 when unset).

    Notes
    -----
    The stock stores carry no dollar-volume column, so the graph passes no
    ``amount`` input. KunQuant's ``Alpha101.AllData`` would otherwise compute
    VWAP as ``amount / volume`` (and raise "Bad inputs" without it), so the
    graph passes the adjusted typical price
    ``(adjHigh + adjLow + adjClose) / 3`` as ``vwap``, as ``Alpha158Stock``
    does.

    --------
    >>> factor = Alpha101Stock(FactorConfig(
    ...     warmup_bars=20, dataset=dataset, mode="batch",
