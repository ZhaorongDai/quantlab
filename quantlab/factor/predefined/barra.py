"""Barra-style risk-factor exposures in the manner of MSCI's USE4 model.

A *style factor* describes one characteristic that explains part of how a
stock's return moves with others: its size, its sensitivity to the market
(beta), its momentum and so on. A stock's *exposure* to a style is a number
saying how much of that characteristic it has, standardized across stocks
so that exposures of different styles are comparable. Each style is built
from one or more *descriptors*, raw measurements such as the log of market
capitalization.

Exposures are standardized over an *estimation universe* (ESTU), here the
``estimation_universe_size`` largest companies by the previous bar's market
cap, each firm counted once (a secondary share class is never in it),
re-ranked every bar inside the graph: on every bar the cap-weighted
mean exposure of the universe is 0 and the equally weighted standard
deviation is 1. Symbols outside the universe are shifted and scaled by the
same numbers, so every symbol with data gets an exposure.

It outputs USE4's styles: Size (descriptor LNCAP), Beta (BETA), Momentum
(RSTR), Residual Volatility (DASTD, CMRA, HSIGMA), Non-linear Size,
Non-linear Beta, Liquidity (STOM, STOQ, STOA), Dividend Yield (YILD),
Book-to-Price (BTOP), Earnings Yield (ETOP, CETOP), Leverage (MLEV, DTOA,
BLEV) and Growth (EGRO, SGRO), as described in Menchero, Orr and Wang, *The
Barra US Equity Model (USE4), Methodology Notes* (MSCI, 2011), and its
Empirical Notes, Appendix A.

Deviations from USE4, the first four because Sharadar sells no analyst
forecasts or preferred-equity field:

- Earnings Yield has no EPFWD (forward earnings): it is the trailing
  CETOP and ETOP only, their USE4 weights renormalized;
- Growth has no EGRLF (analyst long-term growth): it is the historical
  EGRO and SGRO only, their USE4 weights renormalized;
- CETOP's cash earnings, which MSCI does not define, are trailing net
  income to common plus depreciation and amortization;
- preferred equity is taken as 0 in MLEV and BLEV;
- EGRO and SGRO divide the slope by the mean *absolute* annual value, not
  the signed "average annual earnings per share" of the Empirical Notes
  (p.53): a negative average would flip the growth sign of a loss-making
  company. Our choice.

Each descriptor first has its outliers treated on its own distribution
(Methodology Notes §2.2, p.8): over the estimation universe, a value more
than ``data_error_sigma`` equally weighted standard deviations from the
equally weighted mean is dropped as a data error and one beyond
``clip_sigma`` is trimmed to that bound. It is then standardized
(§2.3, p.9, eq. 2.4).

A secondary share class (GOOG beside GOOGL) has no market cap or
fundamentals of its own in Sharadar; it takes its firm's, as named by
``firm_column``, so its Size, valuation and growth exposures are the firm's
while its returns, volume and dividends stay its own.

A style still missing for a symbol (no descriptor at all) is imputed from
a per-bar weighted regression of the style on industry and Size, fitted in
the estimation universe, as USE4 does; every style is then standardized
once more. The symbol's point-in-time industry code is passed through.

A style with several descriptors is their fixed-weight sum over the
descriptors a symbol has, the weights renormalized over those present, so
a symbol missing one descriptor still gets the style. Residual Volatility
is orthogonalized to Beta (Empirical Notes p.16 and p.52): it is replaced
by its residual from a per-bar weighted least-squares regression, with an
intercept, on Beta, fitted in the estimation universe and applied to every
symbol, so it has zero weighted correlation with Beta there. Non-linear
Size follows the text's order (p.55): the Size exposure is cubed,
orthogonalized to Size the same way, then has its outliers treated and is
standardized; Non-linear Beta likewise with Beta. The outlier step comes
after the orthogonalization, so these two are close to, not exactly,
uncorrelated with their regressors.

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class BarraStyleParameters:
    """Formula parameters for ``BarraStyle``, read from ``config.kwargs``.

    Every field can be set through ``FactorConfig.kwargs``; unknown keys are
    refused. Windows are counted in bars of the panel the factor runs on, so
    the defaults assume daily bars. Each field says whether its default is
    USE4's published value or a choice of ours where MSCI publishes none.

    Parameters
    ----------
    price_column : str, default "adjClose"
        Panel variable holding the split- and dividend-adjusted close; the
        return of bar ``t`` is ``price[t] / price[t-1] - 1``.
    market_cap_column : str, default "marketcap"
        Panel variable holding the market capitalization (Sharadar DAILY's
        ``marketcap``, in USD).
    risk_free_column : str, default "risk_free"
        Panel variable holding the risk-free rate as a decimal return per
        bar, the same on every symbol. It is lagged one bar before use,
        because the rate of a day is published the next business day.
    risk_free_symbol : str or None, default None
        When set, the risk-free rate is the ``risk_free_column`` of this one
        symbol (``FredRateDataset``'s ``"DTB3"``, merged in as is) and the
        factor broadcasts it across the other symbols: the symbol is
        dropped, the bars kept are those where any other symbol has a
        ``price_column``, and a bar without a published rate (a bond-market
        holiday on a trading day) takes the last rate before it (our
        choice). ``None`` reads the column on every symbol, already
        broadcast.
    close_column : str, default "close"
        Panel variable holding the raw (unadjusted) close, the price
        Dividend Yield divides by and turnover's dollar volume uses.
    volume_column : str, default "volume"
        Panel variable holding the raw share volume, in the same share basis
        as ``close_column`` on each bar.
    dividend_column : str, default "divCash"
        Panel variable holding the cash dividend per share on its ex-date,
        in that day's share basis, 0 on other bars.
    split_column : str, default "splitFactor"
        Panel variable holding a split's new shares per old share on its
        effective date, 1 on other bars; it converts earlier dividends to
        the current share basis.
    book_equity_column : str, default "equity"
        Book value of common equity (SF1, reporting currency).
    long_term_debt_column : str, default "debtnc"
        Long-term (non-current) debt (SF1, reporting currency).
    total_debt_column : str, default "debt"
        Total debt (SF1), taken as the long-term debt of a company whose
        balance sheet does not split current from non-current (a bank). Our
        choice.
    current_liabilities_column : str, default "liabilitiesc"
        Current liabilities (SF1, reporting currency).
    assets_column : str, default "assets"
        Total assets (SF1, reporting currency).
    earnings_column : str, default "netinccmn"
        Trailing twelve months' net income to common (SF1 ART).
    depreciation_column : str, default "depamor"
        Trailing twelve months' depreciation and amortization (SF1 ART).
    fx_column : str, default "fxusd"
        Reporting currency per USD (SF1 ``fxusd``): an amount in USD is the
        amount divided by it.
    eps_prefix, sales_prefix : str, default "eps_fy", "sps_fy"
        Prefixes of the fiscal-year history variables
        (``SharadarFiscalYearsDataset``): ``<prefix>0`` is the latest fiscal
        year's EPS or sales per share, ``<prefix>1`` the year before.
    fiscal_year_end_prefix : str, default "reportperiod_fy"
        Prefix of the fiscal-year history's fiscal year ends, the time axis
        EGRO and SGRO regress on.
    growth_years : int, default 5
        Fiscal years EGRO and SGRO regress on, the slots ``0 ..
        growth_years - 1`` (USE4: five).
    min_growth_years : int, default 3
        Fewest known fiscal years for EGRO or SGRO to be computed. Our
        choice.
    industry_column : str, default "industry"
        Panel variable holding the point-in-time industry code, a
        non-negative integer (``SharadarIndustryDataset``'s Fama-French 48
        code); passed through as the ``industry`` output.
    firm_column : str, default "firm"
        Panel variable holding the symbol whose market cap and fundamentals
        are this symbol's firm values (``SharadarShareClassDataset``): the
        symbol itself, or for a secondary share class its firm's primary
        class. A secondary class takes the firm's market cap, fundamentals
        and fiscal-year history (``firm_value_columns``) and is never in the
        estimation universe, so the firm is counted once (USE4's LNCAP is
        the firm's total market cap, Empirical Notes p.51). NaN, or a symbol
        not on the panel, leaves the symbol as its own firm. The symbol axis
        must be integers (permatickers).
    estimation_universe_size : int, default 3000
        Number of largest companies, by the previous bar's market cap, in
        the estimation universe. Our choice: USE4 uses the MSCI USA IMI,
        which this approximates; there is no buffer band.
    beta_window : int, default 252
        Bars in the BETA regression window (USE4).
    beta_half_life : float, default 63.0
        Half-life, in bars, of the BETA regression weights (USE4).
    beta_min_observations : int, default 63
        Fewest bars with both a stock and a market return in the BETA window
        for BETA and HSIGMA to be computed; with fewer they are NaN. Our
        choice.
    momentum_window : int, default 504
        Bars in the RSTR window (USE4).
    momentum_half_life : float, default 126.0
        Half-life, in bars, of the RSTR weights (USE4).
    momentum_lag : int, default 21
        Bars RSTR skips before its window, so the latest month is left out
        (USE4).
    momentum_min_observations : int, default 252
        Fewest returns in the RSTR window for RSTR to be computed. Our
        choice.
    dastd_window : int, default 252
        Bars in the DASTD window (USE4).
    dastd_half_life : float, default 42.0
        Half-life, in bars, of the DASTD weights (USE4).
    cmra_months : int, default 12
        Months in CMRA's cumulative range (USE4).
    cmra_month_length : int, default 21
        Bars in one CMRA month (USE4).
    volatility_min_observations : int, default 63
        Fewest returns in the DASTD or CMRA window for that descriptor to be
        computed. Our choice.
    dastd_weight, cmra_weight, hsigma_weight : float, default 0.75, 0.15, 0.10
        Weights of DASTD, CMRA and HSIGMA in Residual Volatility (USE4).
    liquidity_month_length : int, default 21
        Bars in one Liquidity month (USE4).
    stoq_months, stoa_months : int, default 3, 12
        Months averaged by STOQ and STOA (USE4).
    liquidity_min_fraction : float, default 0.5
        Fraction of a Liquidity window's bars that must have a turnover for
        that descriptor to be computed. Our choice.
    stom_weight, stoq_weight, stoa_weight : float, default 0.35, 0.35, 0.30
        Weights of STOM, STOQ and STOA in Liquidity (USE4).
    dividend_window : int, default 252
        Bars of dividends summed by YILD, a trailing year (USE4).
    dividend_min_observations : int, default 126
        Fewest raw closes in the YILD window for YILD to be computed. Our
        choice.
    cetop_weight, etop_weight : float, default 0.15, 0.10
        Weights of CETOP and ETOP in Earnings Yield (USE4; EPFWD's 0.75 is
        dropped and the two renormalized).
    egro_weight, sgro_weight : float, default 0.20, 0.10
        Weights of EGRO and SGRO in Growth (USE4; EGRLF's 0.70 is dropped and
        the two renormalized).
    mlev_weight, dtoa_weight, blev_weight : float, default 0.75, 0.15, 0.10
        Weights of MLEV, DTOA and BLEV in Leverage (USE4).
    imputation_regressors : tuple of str, default ("industry", "size")
        Regressors a missing style is imputed from: ``"industry"`` (one
        intercept per industry), ``"size"`` (the Size exposure), both, or
        neither (``()``: no imputation). Size itself is imputed from the
        industry alone. Our choice: USE4 names industry membership and
        market cap as examples of the factors it uses but publishes no set.
    imputation_weighting : str, default "sqrt_cap"
        Regression weights of the imputation, one of
        ``ORTHOGONALIZATION_WEIGHTINGS``. Our choice.
    orthogonalization_weighting : str, default "sqrt_cap"
        Regression weights of the orthogonalizations: ``"sqrt_cap"`` (the
        square root of the previous bar's market cap), ``"cap"`` or
        ``"equal"``. The default follows USE4: NLSIZE and NLBETA are
        orthogonalized "on a regression-weighted basis" (Empirical Notes
        p.55), and the regression weight is the square root of cap
        (Appendix B, p.56).
    data_error_sigma : float, default 10.0
        Distance from a descriptor's mean over the estimation universe, in
        its standard deviations there (both equally weighted), beyond which
        a value is treated as a data error and dropped. Our choice: USE4
        drops data errors (Methodology Notes §2.2, p.8) but does not publish
        the threshold.
    clip_sigma : float, default 3.0
        Distance from the same mean, in the same standard deviations, a
        value beyond it is trimmed to, before standardizing (USE4: "three
        standard deviations from the mean", §2.2, p.8).

class BarraStyle(FactorKunQuant):
    """USE4-style exposures: standardized descriptors and style factors.

    Reads the panel variables of ``BarraStyleParameters.panel_columns``:
    the adjusted close, the market cap, the risk-free rate, the raw close,
    raw volume, cash dividend and split factor, eight SF1 fundamentals and
    the fiscal-year EPS and sales-per-share history. They usually come from
    a merge of a Sharadar price dataset, the DAILY dataset, the SF1 ART
    fundamentals dataset (whose balance-sheet items equal ARQ's on every
    filing), the fiscal-year history dataset and a risk-free series
    broadcast across symbols, and the share-class firm of each symbol. On
    every bar ``t``:

    - a secondary share class (``firm_column`` naming another symbol)
      takes that symbol's market cap, fundamentals and fiscal-year history
      before anything else is computed;
    - the estimation universe is the ``estimation_universe_size`` symbols
      with the largest market cap at ``t-1``, secondary share classes left
      out;
    - the market return is the universe's return, weighted by the market
      cap at ``t-1``;
    - returns are in excess of the risk-free rate of the bar before (the
      rate of a day is published the next business day); ``excess`` is
      ``r - r_f`` and ``log_excess`` is ``log(1 + r) - log(1 + r_f)``;
    - LNCAP is ``log(marketcap[t])``;
    - BETA is the slope of an exponentially weighted least-squares fit of
      ``excess`` on the market's excess return over the last
      ``beta_window`` bars (half-life ``beta_half_life``), and HSIGMA the
      weighted standard deviation of that fit's residual;
    - RSTR is the exponentially weighted sum of ``log_excess`` over
      ``momentum_window`` bars ending ``momentum_lag`` bars ago (half-life
      ``momentum_half_life``), the weights not normalized (Empirical Notes
      eq. A2, p.52); a bar without a return adds nothing;
    - DASTD is the exponentially weighted standard deviation of ``excess``
      over ``dastd_window`` bars (half-life ``dastd_half_life``);
    - CMRA is ``log(1 + max Z) - log(1 + min Z)``, ``Z(T)`` the sum of
      ``log_excess`` over the last ``T`` months of ``cmra_month_length``
      bars, ``T = 1 .. cmra_months``; NaN when ``min Z <= -1``;
    - a day's turnover is ``volume * close / marketcap``, its dollar volume
      over its market cap: the share count ``marketcap / close`` and the
      volume are on that day's share basis, so a split moves neither. A
      secondary share class's turnover is its dollar volume over its
      firm's market cap, as Sharadar gives no per-class share count. STOM,
      STOQ and STOA are ``log(L * mean turnover)`` over the
      last 1, ``stoq_months`` and ``stoa_months`` months of
      ``L = liquidity_month_length`` bars, which is USE4's
      ``log(sum over a month)`` and ``log(mean over months of exp(STOM))``
      when every day has a turnover; a day without one is left out of the
      mean (our choice), and a window of zero volume only is NaN;
    - YILD is the cash dividends of the last ``dividend_window`` bars,
      each converted to today's share basis through the splits since its
      ex-date, divided by today's raw close;
    - fundamentals are converted to USD by ``fx_column`` where they meet
      the market cap. BTOP is book equity over market cap; ETOP is trailing
      net income to common over market cap and CETOP the same plus
      depreciation and amortization; with long-term debt ``LD`` (the total
      debt where the long-term part is not reported), MLEV is ``1 + LD /
      market cap``, BLEV ``1 + LD / book equity`` (NaN for book equity at
      or below 0, our choice) and DTOA ``(LD + current liabilities) /
      assets`` over the non-current debt only (NaN where it or the current
      liabilities are not reported);
    - EGRO is the slope of a least-squares fit of the fiscal-year EPS
      ``eps_fy0 .. eps_fy<growth_years - 1>`` on time, each year placed at
      its fiscal year end in years before the latest's (so a missing year
      or a moved year end keeps the spacing true), over the years known,
      divided by their mean absolute value; NaN with fewer than
      ``min_growth_years`` known years or a mean of 0. SGRO is the same
      with sales per share. Dividing by the mean absolute value, not the
      signed mean of the text, is our choice;
    - a windowed descriptor is NaN with fewer valid values in its window
      than its ``*_min_observations`` (``liquidity_min_fraction`` of the
      window for Liquidity);
    - each descriptor has its outliers treated, then is standardized: with
      ``m`` and ``s`` the equally weighted mean and standard deviation of
      the raw descriptor over the universe, a value beyond ``m +-
      data_error_sigma * s`` becomes NaN and the rest are clipped to ``m
      +- clip_sigma * s`` (Methodology Notes §2.2, p.8); the result is
      standardized over the universe (market cap at ``t-1`` weighted mean
      0, equally weighted standard deviation 1; §2.3, p.9, eq. 2.4);
    - Size, Beta and Momentum are their one descriptor standardized again;
    - Residual Volatility is ``0.75 DASTD + 0.15 CMRA + 0.10 HSIGMA``
      (``*_weight``) over the descriptors present, standardized,
      orthogonalized against Beta and standardized again (Empirical Notes
      p.16, p.52);
    - Liquidity is ``0.35 STOM + 0.35 STOQ + 0.30 STOA`` over the
      descriptors present, standardized; Dividend Yield is YILD
      standardized again; Book-to-Price is BTOP standardized again;
      Earnings Yield is ``0.15 CETOP + 0.10 ETOP``, Leverage ``0.75 MLEV +
      0.15 DTOA + 0.10 BLEV`` and Growth ``0.20 EGRO + 0.10 SGRO``, each
      over the descriptors present, standardized;
    - a style still missing for a symbol with a market cap on the bar is
      imputed: the style is regressed, with ``imputation_weighting``
      weights over the universe, on one intercept per industry and a slope
      on the Size exposure (``imputation_regressors``; Size itself on the
      industry alone), and the symbol gets its industry's intercept plus
      the slope times its Size. A symbol keeps NaN when its industry has no
      fitted member or a regressor of its own is missing. Every style is
      then standardized once more, imputed values included;
    - the NLSIZE descriptor is the cube of the Size exposure (before
      imputation), orthogonalized against Size, then outlier-treated and
      standardized like any descriptor; Non-linear Size is it standardized
      again. NLBETA and Non-linear Beta are the same with Beta. This is
      the text's order (Empirical Notes p.55), so the outlier step can
      leave a small weighted correlation with the regressor;
    - an orthogonalization is a weighted least-squares regression with an
      intercept, weighted by ``orthogonalization_weighting`` and fitted in
      the universe; every symbol gets its residual, a symbol missing a
      regressor being taken at that regressor's weighted mean (our
      choice). Standardizing afterwards keeps the weighted correlation
      with the regressors at zero.

    Outputs, all on ``(timestamp, symbol)``:

    - ``industry``: the industry code, unchanged;
    - ``estu``: 1 inside the estimation universe of the bar, 0 outside.

    The graph runs in double precision. On 1000 bars of 3008 symbols, with
    a 252-bar BETA window of half-life 63, float32 runs 2x faster but leaves
    errors of 4e-7 in BETA and 6.6e-5 in standardized LNCAP against a
    float64 reference, where double leaves 4e-15 and 3e-10. The factor is batch only: ``mode="stream"`` is
    refused.

    Parameters
    ----------

        ``BarraStyleParameters.warmup_bars`` (526 by default).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``mode`` is not ``"batch"``, ``data_columns`` does not match the
