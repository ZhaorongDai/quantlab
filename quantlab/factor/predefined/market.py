"""Market features: index or ETF series broadcast to every symbol of a panel.

A stock's return depends partly on the market as a whole. MASTER (Li et al.,
AAAI 2024) feeds a model a few *market features* computed from broad
indices, the same values for every stock on a date, and uses them to decide
which stock features matter that day. ``MarketFeatures`` computes those
inputs from one or more index or ETF price series (SPY, QQQ and IWM for US
equities) and broadcasts them to the symbols of a *target* panel, so the
result merges into a model's panel like any other factor's.

For each series the factor computes 21 features on the series' own bars:
the bar return ``ret = close / close[t-1] - 1`` and, for each window d in
5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 bars, ``Mean(ret, d)``, ``Std(ret, d)``,
``Mean(amount, d) / amount`` and ``Std(amount, d) / amount``, where
``amount`` is the dollar value traded in the bar (volume times close unless
the store has its own column). This is the list of
``docs/research/qlib-gats-master.md`` section 2.1.

class MarketFeatures(Factor):
    """Index or ETF features, identical for every symbol that has a bar.

    ``config.dataset`` is the target panel: its symbols receive the
    features, and ``warmup_bars`` (60 by default, the longest window) is
    counted on its calendar. ``config.series`` maps a name to a
    single-symbol dataset; each series gives the 21 features listed in the
    module docstring, named ``<name>_ret``, ``<name>_ret_mean_<d>``,
    ``<name>_ret_std_<d>``, ``<name>_amount_mean_<d>`` and
    ``<name>_amount_std_<d>``, in that order for d in 5, 10, 20, 30, 60.

    The features are computed on each series' own bars and placed on the
    target's timestamps; a target bar the series lacks is NaN. A window is
    defined only when every bar in it is, and the standard deviations use
    ``ddof=1``, as pandas and Qlib do. An amount of 0 gives NaN rather than
    an infinite ratio. On each bar the values go to every target symbol
    whose ``presence_column`` is non-missing there; a symbol without a bar
    (not yet listed, delisted) stays NaN, so the market features do not
    add it to a model's cross-section. The panel is float32, like a
    KunQuant factor's.

    ``config.kwargs`` may set the column names:

    ``close_column`` (default ``"adjClose"``)
        Series variable the return is computed from.
    ``volume_column`` (default ``"adjVolume"``)
        Series variable multiplied by the close into the amount.
    ``amount_column`` (default ``None``)
        Series variable holding the amount itself, used instead of
        volume times close.
    ``presence_column`` (default ``"close"``)
        Target variable that is non-missing where a symbol has a bar.

    Names are looked up after the dataset's ``COLUMN_MAP`` renaming, so a
    crypto spot series is read as ``close``, ``volume`` and ``amount``.
