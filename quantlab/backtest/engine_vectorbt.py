"""vectorbt simulation engine for the backtest layer.

``VectorBtBacktester`` implements the engine hooks of ``BaseBacktester`` on
top of ``vectorbt.Portfolio.from_orders``: target-percent weights, a one-bar
delay between signal and fill, rejected orders, delisting settlements, and
the whole-window portfolio statistics a run directory records. It is the
only module in the package that imports vectorbt; concrete backtesters such
as ``quantlab.backtest.predefined.us_equity`` subclass it and supply the market
conventions and the signal rule. The module is named ``engine_vectorbt``
rather than ``vectorbt`` so it cannot shadow the library it imports.

A *panel* is an ``xarray.Dataset`` indexed by ``timestamp`` and ``symbol``.
A *target-percent weight* is the fraction of portfolio value a symbol should
hold after the order fills; a negative weight is a short position.

    Adjusted prices are anchored at a security's first bar, so a serial
    reverse-splitter ends far below a cent (ASTI's 2024 adjusted close is
    1.6e-13), and vectorbt refuses any order, even a target of 0, at a price
    below about 1e-12. A long window can hold both ends of the fall (a
    stitched ``run_cv`` curve over ten years), so the scale is taken from the
    column's lowest finite positive price, valuation or fill, not its first:
    scaled by its power of 2 that price lies within a factor of sqrt(2) of 1
    and every other price is above it. Multiplying or dividing by a power of 2
    is exact in floating point, so a column already near 1 is untouched and

class VectorBtBacktester(BaseBacktester):
    """Abstract backtester that simulates target weights with vectorbt.

    Subclasses supply ``config_cls``, ``MARKET`` and ``_generate_signals``;
    everything from the weights onward is implemented here. The constructor
    takes one ``config`` argument, an instance of ``config_cls``; see
    ``BaseBacktester``. Three engine conventions matter to a reader of the
    results:

    - A weight row formed at bar ``t`` fills at bar ``t + 1`` at the market's
      fill price (the weights are shifted one bar before they reach
      ``Portfolio.from_orders``).
    - A target percentage is sized against the price ``config.sizing_basis``
      names. ``"fill"`` (the default, vectorbt's own) measures it against the
      portfolio valued at the fill price of the bar it executes on and
      divides by that price. ``"valuation"`` uses the valuation price of the
      signal bar t instead (vectorbt's ``val_price``): the portfolio valued
      at t's close, divided by t's close, as an order placed after the close
      must be sized. Either way the order fills at t + 1's fill price.
    - No borrow or short-financing cost is modelled, so short-side returns
      are optimistic.

    Execution at the fill bar (ADR 0014): both price columns are
    forward-filled before they reach vectorbt, which would otherwise keep a
    NaN-priced holding at its last value and silently skip every later
    rebalance of the whole group. On each fill bar the engine then does what
    a market would:

    - A NaN weight keeps the symbol's holding; a row may mix NaN and finite
      targets.
    - An order whose raw (not forward-filled) fill price is NaN is a
      *rejected order*: the holding is kept and the order expires. It is
      recorded in ``SimulationResult.rejected_orders`` when it would have
      traded (a non-zero target, or a symbol held before the bar).
    - A symbol the price dataset marks as delisted on bar ``b``
      (``MarketDataset.delisting_bars``) is settled on bar ``b + 1``: the
      holding becomes cash at its last valuation price, with no fee or
      slippage, whatever the weights ask for it there. Each settlement is
      recorded in ``SimulationResult.settlements``.

    Records name the symbol by ``symbol`` (the display name: the ticker the
    symbol traded under that day when the price store has a ticker lookup
    file, otherwise the axis label) and ``axis_symbol`` (the label on the
    panel's ``symbol`` axis). A symbol whose prices are NaN at the start of
    the window is not yet listed rather than delisted, and trades normally
    once it lists.

    Trade statistics use vectorbt's position view: one trade is one symbol's
    round trip from entry to flat, so trimming a holding back to its target
    weight is not a closed trade. vectorbt's default exit-trade view counts
    every trim, and because only winners get trimmed under equal weighting it
    inflates the win rate. The number of fills is reported separately as
    ``Total Orders`` in the metrics.
