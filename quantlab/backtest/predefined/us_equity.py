"""The US-equity cross-sectional stock-selection backtester.

``USEquityCrossectionSelectStockVectorBt`` is the concrete backtester of the
pipeline for daily US equities. It composes the ``US_EQUITY_MARKET`` price
conventions, the portfolio construction rule of its config that turns
predictions into target weights, and the vectorbt simulation engine
inherited from ``VectorBtBacktester``. A saved run's ``config.json`` rebuilds it through
``quantlab.utils.module.load_backtester_from_config``.

class USEquityCrossectionSelectStockVectorBt(VectorBtBacktester):
    """Daily US-equity backtester: a portfolio construction rule simulated with vectorbt.

    On every rebalance bar the config's ``constructor`` turns the
    predictions of that bar into target weights, for example the top
    ``top_n`` symbols with ``TopNConstructor``, and the targets are held
    until the next rebalance bar. A symbol is tradable at a bar as the price
    dataset's ``tradable_bars`` says (by default, when it has a fill price
    at that bar), and a held symbol that is not tradable stays locked. The
    class only wires the pieces together: the market conventions are
    ``MARKET``, the rule is the config's ``constructor``, and every engine
    behaviour comes from ``VectorBtBacktester``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : CrossSectionBacktestConfig
        The backtest configuration: price dataset, model, date window and
        output directory, plus ``rebalance_periods`` and ``constructor``.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If ``constructor`` is not a ``PortfolioConstructor``.
    ValueError
        If the constructor refuses the model's labels.
