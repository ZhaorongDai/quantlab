"""Backtester base class and the result types every backtest run produces.

This module sits at the end of the pipeline: a trained return model and a
price dataset go in, and a run directory holding target weights, an equity
curve, metrics and an HTML report comes out. ``BaseBacktester`` owns the
three public entry points, ``run()`` (backtest one model), ``run_cv()``
(replay every fold of a cross-validation run as one continuous curve) and
``run_weights()`` (backtest a precomputed target-weight panel, no model),
and every step between them that does not depend on the simulation engine, plus
``report_figure()``, the report chart of a result held in memory. Engine
layers such as ``VectorBtBacktester`` implement the simulation hooks, and
concrete classes add a ``MarketSpec`` and a signal generator.

A few terms are used throughout. A *panel* is an ``xarray.Dataset`` indexed
by ``timestamp`` and ``symbol``, and a *bar* is one timestamp of it. *Target
weights* are the fraction of portfolio value each symbol should hold after
a rebalance. The *warm-up* is the stretch of bars before the backtest window
that factors need to fill their rolling windows. *In-sample* bars are bars
the model was trained on (including the bars its labels looked ahead into),
and *out-of-sample* bars are bars it never saw; results are reported for
both separately. A *fold* is one train/test split of a walk-forward
cross-validation run (``train_cv``), and the *stitched* curve simulates the
test segments of all folds back to back. A *fingerprint* is a hash of the
data a run read, stored so that a later rebuild of the run can tell whether
the data has changed. The backtester does not decide what is fingerprinted:
it opens a ``quantlab.runs.record.DataRecorder`` around each run, each
``run_cv`` fold and the stitched pass, and every dataset or factor store read
inside it is recorded under its component path.

class Predictor(Protocol):
    """What the backtester needs from a model: the whole contract between the two.

    ``BacktestConfig.model`` is any object with these members; ``BaseModel``
    has them without inheriting this class, and so can an ensemble that
    composes several models. The backtester reads no model config and calls
    no other model method, so a predictor built from models with different
    configs is backtested unchanged. A config whose ``model`` lacks a member
    is refused at construction.

    Attributes
    ----------
    labels : list
        The label objects, whose ``lookahead_bars()`` extends the effective
        training window of the in-sample split and whose variable names are
        the prediction variables.
    train_bounds, test_bounds : tuple
        The ``(start, end)`` training and test windows: as configured, or,
        after ``load``, as the checkpoint records them.
    fitted_train_bounds : tuple
        The ``(start, end)`` training window actually fitted, after the
        purge; known after ``train`` or ``load``. The in-sample split starts
        from it.
    label_delays : tuple[int, ...]
        Each label's ``delay`` in bars, in the order of ``labels``; each must
        equal the engine's ``fill_delay_bars``.
    label_scales : dict[str, str]
        Each label name's prediction scale: ``"raw"`` when the prediction is
        in the label's own units, ``"standardized"`` when it only ranks the
        cross-section (a model fitted on a transformed target, a label an
        ensemble averages). A rule that needs return units checks it.

    Methods
    -------
    predict_window(start, end)
        The predictions for every bar from ``start`` to ``end``, one variable
        per label on ``(timestamp, symbol)``; the predictor requests its own
        features, warm-up included.
    collect(), train()
        Train-mode preparation; ``train`` returns the checkpoint it wrote.
    load(path), check_checkpoint(path)
        Load-mode preparation; ``check_checkpoint`` validates a checkpoint
        without loading it and runs first.
    get_config(), from_config(config, run_dir=None)
        A JSON-ready dict naming the class in ``"name"``, and the class
        method that rebuilds the predictor from it.

    engine layer such as ``VectorBtBacktester`` that implements
    ``_simulate``, ``_simulate_benchmark`` and ``_engine_stats`` and sets
    ``fill_delay_bars``, then a named concrete class that composes a
    ``MarketSpec`` (the ``MARKET`` class attribute) and a signal generator
    (``_generate_signals``) onto that engine. Concrete classes also set
    ``config_cls``, the config class the ``config`` setter accepts.

    The public entry points ``run()``, ``run_cv()`` and ``run_weights()``
    are defined here and never overridden. ``run()`` and ``run_cv()`` run the
    same fixed sequence of steps and call the hooks above along the way:
    prepare the model, request the factor panels for the window and predict,
    generate signals, simulate, compute metrics, then write the run

    config : BacktestConfig
        The backtest configuration, an instance of ``config_cls``. It is
        validated and normalized on assignment; see the ``config`` setter.

    Attributes
    ----------
    MARKET : MarketSpec or None
        The market conventions. ``None`` on abstract classes; a concrete
        class must set it.
    fill_delay_bars : int
        Bars between the bar a weight forms on and the bar it fills on, set
        by the engine layer. ``run()`` and ``run_cv()`` refuse a model whose
        label ``delay`` differs from it, since the label would then measure
        a return the engine never trades.
    expected_fingerprint : dict or None
        The data fingerprint of a previous run of the same config (the
        stitched pass of a ``run_cv`` run). When set, each run compares the
        data it reads against it, by digest, and warns on a difference. It
        is filled in when a run is rebuilt with
        ``BacktestRun.rebuild_backtester``.
    expected_fold_fingerprints : dict or None
        The data fingerprint of each fold of a previous ``run_cv`` run, by
        fold index; each fold of ``run_cv`` compares with its own and the
        warning names the fold. Filled in by ``rebuild_backtester`` too.
    expected_training_fingerprint, expected_training_code : dict or None
        The training data record and the code record of the trained unit a
        previous train-mode run used. When set, a train-mode ``run()``
        compares the unit it trains with them and warns on a difference.

        Subclasses do not override this method. No model is involved:
        ``config.model`` and ``config.model_mode`` are ignored and may both
        be ``None``, and ``_generate_signals`` is not called. The fill and
        valuation prices of ``config.price_dataset`` are read for the window
        ``config.start_date``..``config.end_date``, the weights are checked
        against the target-weight contract on exactly those bars, and the
        engine simulates them (a weight formed at bar t fills at bar t+1's
        fill price). The benchmark, when configured, is simulated and
        compared as in ``run()``. There is no training window, so the metrics
        cover the whole window only: ``whole`` (plus ``benchmark`` and
        ``relative``, each with a ``whole`` block, when a benchmark ran) and
        ``notes``, with no in-sample or out-of-sample block. The run
        directory is written like ``run()``'s when ``config.output_dir`` is
        set; the data fingerprints cover the prices and the benchmark.

        Parameters
        ----------
        weights : xarray.Dataset or xarray.DataArray
            Target weights on ``(timestamp, symbol)``, in either axis order.
            A dataset must carry a ``weight`` variable; a data array is used
            whatever its name. A run's weights, read with
            ``BacktestRun.open(run_dir).weights()``, replay that run. The
            timestamps must be exactly the price bars
            of the window and the symbols exactly the price dataset's
            symbols, in any order (they are aligned to the price axes). A
            NaN keeps the symbol's holding and a finite value is its target;
            the targets of a row have a gross exposure, the sum of their
            absolute values, of at most 1.

        Returns
        -------
        BacktestResult
            The run directory (``None`` without ``output_dir``), the weights
            aligned to the price axes, the simulation, the metrics and the
            benchmark simulation; ``predictions`` is ``None``.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the window has no price bars, the weights are not on
            ``(timestamp, symbol)``, their bars or symbols differ from the
            prices' (naming the first missing or extra ones), or a row breaks
            the contract (naming the offending bar).
