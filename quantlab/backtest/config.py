"""The configs of the backtest layer.

A backtester is constructed from a ``BacktestConfig`` subclass and exposes it as
``self.config``. Unlike the dataset, factor and model configs these are not frozen.
The price dataset, the model, the portfolio construction rule, the benchmark and
the tracker are declared with ``component()``, so ``to_dict()`` writes each as its
own config and the backtester can be rebuilt from the run's ``config.json`` (see
``quantlab.core.component``). The execution settings (sizing basis, fees, slippage)
are those of ``quantlab.execution.rules``.

Fields are documented with ``#:`` comments so the meaning of each one sits beside
its definition.
