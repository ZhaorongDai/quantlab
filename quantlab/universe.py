"""Point-in-time US equity symbol universe, free of survivorship bias.

A *universe* is the list of symbols a strategy may consider. It is
*point-in-time* when it answers "which symbols existed, or belonged to an
index, on this date" rather than "which symbols exist today". Using today's
list for a past date causes *survivorship bias*: companies that later went
bankrupt or were delisted are missing, so the backtest only ever sees the
survivors and looks better than it should.

This module builds and queries a reference table that answers the
point-in-time question for US stocks. Two kinds of fetcher produce its rows.
``TiingoRosterFetcher`` subclasses (``NasdaqUniverseFetcher``,
``USEquityUniverseFetcher``) download exchange-wide rosters of common stock,
delisted names included, from the ticker directory of the market-data vendor
Tiingo. ``IndexMembershipFetcher`` subclasses (``SP500MembershipFetcher``,
``Nasdaq100MembershipFetcher``) rebuild the dates each stock joined and left
an index from a snapshot of today's members plus Wikipedia's historical
change log. ``UniverseCatalog`` merges both into one parquet table with the
columns ``symbol``, ``category``, ``start_date``, ``end_date`` and
``end_date_is_inferred``, and answers point-in-time queries against it.

``UniverseCatalog`` also hosts the acquisition volume guard. Before a
download starts, the guard estimates its disk size, request count and run
time, and refuses one that would exceed a ceiling. The guard has to refuse
before any download client exists, so this module must never import an
acquisition client, in any spelling, and the package ``__init__`` files on
its import path stay empty. Keeping every client out of this module's
imports makes the guarantee hold whatever order callers use.

See ``docs/constituent.md`` for a guide.

    """Base class for exchange-wide common-stock rosters built from Tiingo.

    A *roster* here is the list of every stock ever listed on a set of
    exchanges, each with its listing and delisting dates. This class
    downloads Tiingo's ``supported_tickers.csv`` directory, which lists every
    ticker the vendor has ever carried with those dates, and filters it down
    to one roster. Using the full directory rather than a feed of currently
    listed names keeps delisted names in the roster, which is what keeps the
    universe free of survivorship bias.

    A subclass is data, not code: it sets ``EXCHANGE_FILTER``,
    ``MIN_ROSTER_ROWS`` and ``CATEGORY`` (and optionally
    ``EXCLUDE_NON_COMMON_SECURITY_TYPES``) and inherits ``fetch`` unchanged.

    ``fetch`` filters on exact string tokens, so a vocabulary change in the
    vendor's feed would yield zero rows without raising. ``MIN_ROSTER_ROWS``
    turns that silent truncation into an error before the catalog can overwrite
    a good reference table with an empty one.

    The result is a set of *membership intervals*: one row per stay in the
    index, with the date the stock joined and the date it left (null while
    it is still a member). An index is described by data: a subclass sets
    the class constants below and implements ``fetch_anchor``, and inherits
    the change-log parse, the rebuild algorithm and the caching of
    ``fetch_changes``.

    Two sources are combined. The *anchor* is a snapshot of today's members
    and is trusted for who is a member now. The *change log* is Wikipedia's
    dated table of additions and removals and is trusted for when
    membership changed. ``reconstruct_intervals`` replays the log forward
    and reconciles it with the anchor.

    A subclass sets ``ANCHOR_URL``, ``CHANGES_URL``, ``PIT_COVERAGE_START``
    (the earliest date the change log covers; point-in-time queries before
    it are refused), ``CACHE_FILENAME`` (the per-index change-log snapshot
    under ``cache_dir``), ``INDEX_LABEL``, ``CATEGORY``,
    ``EXPECTED_SOURCE_HEADER`` (the flattened header that identifies the
    change-log table) and ``DATE_HEADER``. ``CHANGES_TABLE_ATTRS`` is
    optional.

    Three safety checks live on this base so every index gets them. The
    change-log table is picked by matching its header against
    ``EXPECTED_SOURCE_HEADER`` and its columns are read by name, so a
    reordered header raises instead of quietly swapping additions and
    removals. A live table with fewer rows than the cached snapshot is
    treated as a parse failure, because the log only grows. On any fetch or
    parse failure the cached snapshot is returned and the cache file is
    left as it was.

    ----------
    cache_dir : str
        Directory holding the cached change-log snapshot.

    Attributes
    ----------
    changes_are_stale : bool
        Whether the last ``fetch_changes`` result came from the cache

        The anchor is trusted for who is a member today; the change log is
        trusted for when membership changed. Three disagreements between
        them are resolved, each with a warning:

        1. A stay still open at the end of the log whose symbol is not in
           the anchor is closed at the last date the log covers and marked
           ``end_date_is_inferred=True``, because the log never says when it
           ended.
        2. A symbol whose last event is a removal but which the anchor still
           lists is re-opened from that removal date, because the log is
           missing a re-addition.
        3. An anchor member with no event in the log is opened at its
           ``date_added``, or at ``PIT_COVERAGE_START`` when that is null.

        A removal with no earlier addition opens at ``PIT_COVERAGE_START``,
        and a duplicate addition keeps the earlier start date.

        Parameters
        ----------
        anchor : pl.DataFrame
            A ``[symbol, date_added]`` frame as returned by
            ``fetch_anchor``.
        changes : pl.DataFrame
            A frame as returned by ``fetch_changes``, with ``None`` where
            a row has no ticker on one side.

        Returns
        -------
        pl.DataFrame
            A frame with columns ``symbol``, ``start_date``, ``end_date`` (null for

    ``PIT_COVERAGE_START`` is the earliest row of the Wikipedia change table
    (2007-02-01), about three decades later than the S&P 500's, so the two
    categories must not be unioned onto one axis that implies coverage neither
    has.

    The anchor is scraped from a commercial listing page (``ANCHOR_URL``),
    because Wikipedia's Nasdaq-100 page renders its components through a
    template with no parseable table. It is the least stable input in this
    module, which is why ``fetch_anchor`` has a row-count floor of its own. The
    live anchor has 102 rows, not 100, because some issuers carry two share
    classes (``GOOGL``/``GOOG``, ``FOX``/``FOXA``). Neither source carries a
    ``date_added`` column, so the anchor's is all null and every member without
    a change-log event opens at ``PIT_COVERAGE_START``.

class UniverseCatalog:
    """Point-in-time reference table of US equity universes.

    Builds one table with the columns ``symbol``, ``category``,
    ``start_date``, ``end_date`` and ``end_date_is_inferred`` from every
    roster fetcher in ``ROSTER_FETCHERS`` and every index membership fetcher
    in ``MEMBERSHIP_FETCHERS``. A *category* names one universe, such as
    ``"us_all"`` or ``"sp500_constituent"``. The table is saved as parquet
    through ``PlBackend`` and answers point-in-time queries. Dates are ISO
    ``YYYY-MM-DD`` strings throughout and are compared as text, which gives
    the right order for that format.

    A walk-forward backtest, which steps through time and rebalances as it
    goes, must call ``get_symbols_as_of`` on each rebalance date rather than
    once at setup. Otherwise the symbol list reflects later dates, and the
    backtest uses information it could not have had (look-ahead bias).

    The catalog also estimates the cost of downloads.
    ``estimate_acquisition_volume`` and ``assert_acquisition_volume_fits``
    work purely from the listing intervals; they send no request to a vendor
    and create no download client.

    Parameters
    ----------

        A row overlaps when ``start_date <= end`` and ``end_date`` is null or
        ``>= start``. A symbol that delisted inside the window is therefore
        kept; dropping it would be exactly the survivorship bias this table

        history; use ``get_symbols_as_of`` at each rebalance of a
        walk-forward backtest.

        The result has no duplicates and is sorted ascending. Callers rely on
        the order, for example to take the first N symbols with ``--limit``,
        so it must depend only on which symbols match and not on the row
        order of the parquet file.

            Required for ``"tick"``, ignored otherwise.
