"""Restrict a market panel to an index's point-in-time membership.

A *panel* is an ``xarray.Dataset`` indexed by ``timestamp`` and ``symbol``.
*Point-in-time* membership records which symbols belonged to an index on
each past day, as known on that day. Testing a strategy only on today's
members instead causes *survivorship bias*: companies that were later
delisted or dropped from the index silently disappear from history, which
makes results look better than they were.

``UniverseMask`` lines up a boolean ``is_member`` panel from a constituent
dataset with a market-data panel. It reports which index members the market
data does not cover, and returns the market panel with every non-member cell
set to NaN. It combines two concrete datasets rather than defining an
abstract interface, so it lives beside the datasets instead of in
``quantlab.base``.

class UniverseMask:
    """Restrict a market panel to an index's point-in-time membership.

    Both panels are cut down to the timestamps and symbols they share.
    Missing symbols are treated differently on each side, on purpose. An
    index member that the market panel lacks is a coverage gap that would
    quietly bring back survivorship bias (delisted names are the hardest to
    obtain), so ``report()`` names every one of them. A market symbol
    outside the index is simply not in the universe and is dropped without
    comment. Timestamps are intersected without a report, because the
    membership panel has a row for every calendar day while market data only
    has trading days, so dropped rows are expected.

    Nothing here fetches data. The constructor takes two in-memory
    ``xarray.Dataset`` objects, so the class works without a store;
    ``from_datasets`` is the constructor used in a pipeline run.

    Parameters
    ----------
    market : xr.Dataset
        A market panel on ``(timestamp, symbol)``.
    membership : xr.Dataset
        A panel with a boolean ``is_member`` variable.
    ticker_lookup : CrspTickerLookup, optional
        Only used to print readable tickers in ``report()``'s warning when
        the symbol axis holds CRSP PERMNOs (CRSP's permanent integer
        security ids). ``None`` prints the axis labels as they are.

    Attributes
    ----------
    market : xr.Dataset
        The market panel as given.
    membership : xr.Dataset
        The membership panel as given.
    ticker_lookup : CrspTickerLookup or None
        The lookup used for readable labels.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``membership`` has no ``is_member`` variable, which usually
        means the two panels were passed in the wrong order.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> mask = UniverseMask.from_datasets(market_dataset, constituent_dataset)
    >>> mask.report()["missing_count"]
    1
    >>> panel = mask.apply()  # non-member cells are NaN

    The method examples below use a market panel of ``AAA``, ``BBB`` and
    ``CCC`` over four business days and a membership panel over six
    calendar days in which ``AAA`` and ``DDD`` are members throughout.
