"""Resume ledgers: the JSON sidecars that let an interrupted download or conversion continue.

A *sidecar* is a small bookkeeping file stored next to the data it describes. Two
ledgers share its mechanics (``_Sidecar``: an atomic rewrite, the symbol count and
fingerprint last written) and differ in what they protect, so each keeps its own
reading rules and its own fingerprint:

- ``ChunkLedger`` records which time windows chunked ingestion already appended to
  a Zarr store, so a conversion resumes at the first window not yet written.
  *Chunked ingestion* converts raw vendor data one time window at a time: each
  window is *densified* (a full ``timestamp`` by ``symbol`` grid, NaN where a
  symbol has no bar) and appended, so peak memory depends on the window size.
  ``TimeChunkPlanner`` splits the observed timestamps into such windows. Its
  ``axis_fingerprint`` hashes the symbols *in order*: a new window's columns
  must line up with those already stored.
- ``PageLedger`` records, for one *batch* (a multi-symbol request a vendor such
  as Alpaca answers as a chain of pages, each carrying a ``next_page_token``),
  which pages were fetched, the token the next request must carry and the parquet
  *shards* holding each page's rows, so a download continues from the middle of a
  batch instead of paying again for every page. Its ``roster_fingerprint`` hashes
  the *sorted* symbols: a batch is the same request whatever order its roster was
  given in. A corrupt page sidecar reads back empty (the batch is re-fetched); a
  chunk sidecar that disagrees with its store raises.

``ChunkLedger`` is used by ``quantlab.dataset.base``; ``PageLedger`` by the
acquisition engine (``quantlab.acquisition``). The module imports only pandas,
xarray and the atomic JSON writer.

    """JSON sidecar recording which pages of one batch have been fetched.

    Ledgers live under ``{watermark_path}/_pages/``. ``watermark_path`` is
    the directory of per-symbol progress files, kept outside the raw data
    tree because a polars scan of that tree would fail on a ``.json`` file.

    There is one file per batch, and therefore one writer per file. Batches
    are fetched from several worker threads at once, and updating the
    in-memory record before each write is not atomic, so one shared file
    would need a lock. If these files are ever merged into one, a
    ``threading.Lock`` around the update and the write becomes necessary. A
    missing file is an empty ledger, which is the normal state on a first run.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        Location of the sidecar file; see ``default_path``.
    symbols : Sequence[str] or None, default None

    Attributes
    ----------
    path : str

    def assert_consistent(self, raw_root: str) -> None:
        """Raise if the ledger records a page whose shard is missing on disk.

        The ledger and the shard files are two records of the same download,
        written at different moments. A shard is always written before its
        ledger entry, so a crash between the two only costs a re-fetch that
        overwrites the same file. The opposite case, a recorded page whose
        shard is missing, means a shard was deleted or the raw directory was
        moved. Resuming would then leave a gap in the batch that no later
        read could detect.

        Parameters
        ----------
        raw_root : str
            Directory that relative shard paths are resolved against.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If a recorded page names no shard, or names a shard that does not
            exist. The message says how to recover.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> ledger.assert_consistent(raw_root)  # every shard present
        >>> Path(raw_root, "raw", "part-00000.pqt").unlink()
        >>> ledger.assert_consistent(raw_root)
