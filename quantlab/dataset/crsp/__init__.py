"""CRSP Stock v2 daily price panel with PERMNOs as the symbol axis.

CRSP (the Center for Research in Security Prices) is a US stock database
sold through WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services); ``dsf_v2`` is its daily
stock file. A PERMNO is CRSP's permanent integer id for one security; unlike
a ticker it never changes and is never reused, so a renamed or delisted
company keeps one column for its whole history. A *panel* is an
``xarray.Dataset`` indexed by ``timestamp`` and ``symbol``, the format every
quantlab layer exchanges.

The acquisition step stores the ``dsf_v2`` rows unchanged as the *raw tier*,
one parquet file (shard) per PERMNO. ``CrspStockDataset`` converts it into
the same dense ``(timestamp, symbol)`` Zarr panel that ``StockDataset``
produces for Tiingo: the twelve Tiingo variables plus the CRSP extras in
``CRSP_EXTRA_VARIABLES``. A factor, label or backtester can therefore read a
CRSP store without knowing the vendor. The ``symbol`` coordinate is the
integer PERMNO. The ticker each PERMNO had on each date is written to a
*sidecar* JSON file next to the store and read back by
``quantlab.dataset.crsp.tickers``.

For each PERMNO, sorted by date, the conversion derives:

- ``close = abs(dlyprc)``, except that a delisting-amount row (``dlyprcflg``
  in ``_NO_PRICE_FLAGS``, or ``dlyprc == 0``) carries no price and is NaN.
- ``adjClose`` (the split- and dividend-adjusted close): the PERMNO's first
  usable close inside the window (the *anchor* row), grown by
  ``prod(1 + dlyret)`` since that row. A null return counts as a factor of
  1, because a CRSP return already spans any gap back to the previous valid
  price. ``adjOpen``/``adjHigh``/``adjLow`` are scaled by
  ``adjClose / close``, and ``adjVolume`` by ``dlycumfacshr`` (CRSP's
  cumulative share-adjustment factor) relative to the anchor row.
- ``splitFactor = dlycumfacpr[t-1] / dlycumfacpr[t]`` (1.0 on the first row)
  and ``divCash = dlyorddivamt + dlynonorddivamt`` on the ex-date.

The adjustment is computed once over the whole configured window before any
date slicing, so converting in chunks and converting in one go produce the
same store. ``ret`` keeps a missing CRSP return as NaN rather than 0. The
delisting return is applied exactly once: CRSP already puts it on the
delisting day's row, so nothing adds ``stkdelists.delret`` on top. A
*security filter* keeps only the security types asked for (for example
common stock) and writes a report of what it dropped next to the store.

#: Variables the panel has beyond the twelve Tiingo ones, with their CRSP

#:
#: ``permco`` is CRSP's company id (one company can have several securities).
#: ``ret`` and ``retx`` are ``dlyret``/``dlyretx``, the daily return with and
#: without dividends, NaN where CRSP has none. ``shrout`` and ``market_cap``
#: are ``shrout``/``dlycap`` times 1000, so the panel holds shares and USD
#: rather than thousands. ``bid``/``ask`` are ``dlybid``/``dlyask``.
#: ``prc_is_bidask`` is 1.0 when ``dlyprcflg == "BA"`` (the price is a
#: bid/ask midpoint because there was no trade), 0.0 otherwise and NaN when
#: the flag is null; ``is_delisting`` encodes ``dlydelflg == "Y"`` the same
#: way. ``numtrd`` is ``dlynumtrd`` (number of trades); ``cumfacpr`` and
#: ``cumfacshr`` are CRSP's cumulative price and share adjustment factors;
#: ``facprc`` is ``dlyfacprc``, the day's own price factor (1.0 on an
#: ordinary day, 4.0 on a 4:1 split). ``close_trade`` is ``dlyclose``, the
#: price of the last trade, which is null on bid/ask days and on delisting
#: rows and is therefore not used as the panel's ``close``.

class CrspStockDataset(StockDataset):
    """Dense daily panel built from the CRSP raw files, keyed by PERMNO.

    The class reuses ``StockDataset``'s scan of the raw tree (vendor root,
    ``month=`` hive partitions, the single-vendor check, date-window filters
    and ``has_raw_data``). It overrides how the axes and each window's dense
    panel are built, because both must use the adjusted *derivation* (the
    frame of computed panel variables) rather than the raw rows: the raw
    ``symbol`` column is the PERMNO as a string, and every derived variable
    is computed here.

    Each conversion also writes two sidecars next to the store, the filter
    report and the ticker table (see ``filter_report_path`` and
    ``ticker_sidecar_path``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset_config : CrspDatasetConfig
        Must have ``frequency="1d"`` and ``vendor="wrds"``. The inherited
        ticker-based ``symbols`` field must be unset; use ``permnos`` to
        convert only some securities. ``reference_dir`` points to the
        downloaded CRSP reference tables, ``security_filter`` chooses which
        security types to keep, and ``roster_universe`` optionally names an
        index whose members are kept regardless of the filter.

    Examples
    --------
    Build the store from raw files already downloaded from WRDS (the paths
    follow the layout the download writes under the data root), then read

        the ``symbol`` column is cast to the int64 PERMNO, and the adjustment
        anchor is chosen per PERMNO over that whole frame. Only then does
        ``_raw_data_to_xr_window`` cut out date windows. Because of this
        order, every chunk size produces the same store: a window never picks
        an anchor of its own. The result is cached on the instance and
        cleared when the config changes. Both conversion entry points go
        through here, so anything that must happen exactly once per
        conversion belongs here.

        The anchor is each PERMNO's first row inside the window with a
        strictly positive ``close`` and a non-null ``dlycumfacshr``. A store
        that only grows forward in time therefore keeps every past value.
        Two changes, however, silently rescale a security's whole adjusted
        history: moving ``start_date`` later, and adding raw rows earlier

        the ``permnos`` roster and the security filter are already applied. A
