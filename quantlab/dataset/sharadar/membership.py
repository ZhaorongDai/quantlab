"""Point-in-time S&P 500 membership from Sharadar's SP500 table, keyed by permaticker.

The SP500 table records each change to the index: an ``added`` or ``removed``
row whose ``date`` is the *effective* membership date (not the announcement),
plus a ``historical`` snapshot of every member at each calendar quarter end
and a ``current`` snapshot dated on the vendor's last refresh. Tickers are
Sharadar's current identifiers, so a renamed company's history sits under
its present ticker and maps to one permaticker through TICKERS.

A stock is a member from its ``added`` date and is no longer one on its
``removed`` date, so a spell ends the day before the removal. The changes go
back to the index's launch in 1957, but Sharadar's prices (and so its
permatickers) start on ``PIT_COVERAGE_START``, 1997-12-31: a spell that ended
before then is dropped, whether or not the company kept trading, and the
panel answers membership from that date. So a roster (``roster_universe``)
is the same whether its window starts before or on that date. A former member Sharadar never priced is dropped
with a warning naming it; a member to the table's end without a permaticker
is refused, because it means TICKERS is older than SP500. A member whose first recorded change is a removal
is taken as a member since ``PIT_COVERAGE_START``; a member with no change at
all was in the index throughout. Every spell ends by the table's last date, so a panel
built from the same raw file is the same whenever it is built.
