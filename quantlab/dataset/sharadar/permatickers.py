"""Map the tickers of Sharadar's raw files to permatickers, as of each file's pull.

Sharadar keys every table but TICKERS by ticker, and renames a security's
whole history when its ticker changes (LESL became LESLQ: every LESL row
reads LESLQ from then on). Each raw file therefore names its securities by
the tickers *of its own pull*: a bulk file pulled before a change holds the
old ticker, a window pulled after it the new one. TICKERS, pulled whole every
run, holds only each permaticker's current ticker, so the old ticker of a
file pulled before a change is not in it.

``PermatickerResolver`` maps one file at a time (``annotate``, the hook of
``scan_raw_table``), each ticker in this order:

1. the TICKERS snapshot of the file's own run (``tables.snapshot_for``),
   which knows exactly the tickers of that pull. A ticker the snapshot gives
   to two permatickers is refused, as TICKERS always was.
2. otherwise the ticker's *holders*, the securities known to have used it:
   the permaticker current TICKERS gives it to (a ticker current TICKERS
   gives to two permatickers is refused); the securities the ACTIONS
   ``tickerchangefrom`` chain says used it, each from its change into the
   ticker (or its first price) until its change away
   (``ticker_changes``); the security TICKERS renamed to the ticker plus a
   number when another took the ticker over (NSTR became NSTR1), often with
   no ACTIONS row: its ``relatedtickers`` lists the old ticker, held from its
   first to its last price (``related_spans``); and, for a store with one,
   the securities its ticker sidecar (``<store>.sharadar_tickers.json``)
   names by it, the sidecar having been written from an earlier TICKERS. A ticker with a single
   holder maps to it, whatever the dates (so a vendor slow to rename a
   security still maps). Several holders (the ticker was reused) are told
   apart by the file's pull date: the holder whose span covers it, the
   latest-starting one if several do, or the latest to have used it if none
   does. A change dated on the pull's own day counts from the next day, as
   the vendor applies it in its evening update.

   A holder is not taken when another security, under any table, held the
   ticker at the file's pull: the old ticker of a stock that a fund (SFP)
   has taken over names the fund in a file of that pull (ACTIONS and SF3A
   hold funds; ACTIONS names the FB fund's dividends FB, not Meta's, #235).
   Who held it is the file's own TICKERS snapshot, or without one current
   TICKERS, each security counted from the day after it took the ticker (its
   last ACTIONS ticker change, else its first price).

A row whose ticker none of them maps is left out rather than refused:
``left_out`` drops it, logs a warning and writes the report
``<store>.unmapped.json`` (``UNMAPPED_SUFFIX``) naming each ticker's first
and last date, row count and raw files, so a daily update completes. So does
a ticker whose holders tie (two securities starting on the same day).

One security can then have rows under two tickers for one key: SF3A, pulled
whole, keeps some quarters of a security under its current ticker and under
a former one. ``settle`` keeps one row per security and key (the security's
own ticker as of the file's pull, else the ticker it used on the row's date,
else one of rows identical but for their ticker) and leaves out, as
unmapped, the rows it cannot choose between.

        column selection keeping ``ticker``, ``permaticker`` and
        ``date_column``).
    store_path : str or Path, optional
        The store the rows feed: the report goes to
        ``<store_path>.unmapped.json`` (``UNMAPPED_SUFFIX``). ``None`` writes
        no report.
    sidecar_path : str or Path, optional
        A ticker sidecar to map old tickers with (``PermatickerResolver``).
    date_column : str, default "date"
        The column the report dates rows by.
    quiet : bool, default False
        Log the left-out rows at ``info`` (``PermatickerResolver.left_out``).
    key : iterable of str, optional
        The columns (after ``query``) that, with the permaticker, name one
        row: rows of one security under several tickers on one key are
        settled (``PermatickerResolver.settle``). ``None`` settles nothing.
    report_unmapped : bool, default True
        ``PermatickerResolver.left_out``.

    Returns
    -------
    pl.DataFrame
        The rows with a ``permaticker`` column, unmapped ones left out.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a ticker maps to several permatickers in TICKERS or in its file's
        TICKERS snapshot.
