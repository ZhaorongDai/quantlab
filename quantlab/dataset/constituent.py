"""Point-in-time index-membership panels, one class per index and source.

*Point-in-time* membership records which securities belonged to an index on
each past day, as known on that day. Using today's member list for the past
instead would cause *survivorship bias*: the backtest would only ever hold
companies that later survived. A membership panel is an ``xarray.Dataset``
indexed by ``timestamp`` and ``symbol`` whose ``is_member`` variable is True
on the days a symbol was a member.

Each class here plugs one membership source into the shared panel builder
``quantlab.base.constituent.IndexConstituentDataset`` by implementing its two
hooks, ``_pit_coverage_start`` and ``_build_intervals``. Two sources cover the
S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100:

- ``SP500ConstituentDataset`` and ``Nasdaq100ConstituentDataset`` replay a
  public Wikipedia change log and use tickers as the ``symbol`` axis.
- ``CrspSP500ConstituentDataset`` and ``CompustatNasdaq100ConstituentDataset``
  read locally downloaded CRSP reference tables and use the int64 PERMNO as
  the ``symbol`` axis.

CRSP (the Center for Research in Security Prices) is a US stock database
sold through WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services). A PERMNO is CRSP's
permanent integer id for one security; unlike a ticker it never changes or
gets reused, and it is also the ``symbol`` axis of the CRSP price panel, so
the two line up column for column. ``CrspMarketConstituentDataset`` is the
whole-market variant: every security CRSP lists, not an index.

``config.cache_dir`` is the local directory the panel is built from: the
cache of scraped web pages for the Wikipedia classes, and the CRSP reference
directory for the CRSP classes. The CRSP classes only read parquet files on
disk and need no WRDS login.

    Compustat is S&P's company-fundamentals database, also sold through

    id). Intervals come from ``CrspMembership``, which reads Compustat's
    index-constituent history from the reference directory at

    a PERMNO through the CRSP/Compustat Merged (CCM) link table. The
    ``symbol`` axis is the int64 PERMNO. Coverage starts on 1995-01-01,
    where Compustat's history begins (the memberships themselves may be
    older); the panel never starts earlier.

    A membership interval with no PERMNO link is an error by default,
    because dropping it would silently shrink the universe. Pass
    ``kwargs={"allow_unlinked": True}`` to keep the linked days and see the
    rest in the membership report. The option lives in the config so a run

    This is not an index. Here ``is_member`` says whether a security was
