"""The run record: what a run read and which code it ran.

A run is reproducible from its config, its data and its code. This module records
the last two and compares them with an earlier run's record. Its interface:

- ``DataRecorder``, the context a run opens to learn what it read, and
  ``record_read``, which the two read seams (``BaseDataset.panel`` and
  ``Factor.read``) call; ``unrecorded`` hides reads from every open recorder;
- ``code_record`` and ``code_of``, the code a component tree ran;
- ``compare``, which compares two provenance records
  (``{"data_fingerprint": ..., "code": ...}``) and logs one warning per difference.

**Data.** Stores are appended to and adjusted prices are re-based retroactively, so
a stored run is reproducible only if the data under it has not changed. Inside an
open recorder a read is logged as a request (dataset, the first and last bar read,
symbols, variables); outside one ``record_read`` returns at once. When the recorder
closes, each distinct request is read again once and hashed: the time range, the
axis sizes and a sha256 digest over the values of the variables read. NaN has many
bit patterns, so every NaN is rewritten to one canonical NaN and every ``-0.0`` to
``0.0`` before hashing; otherwise two reads of identical data could report
different digests. The records are compared with an expected record when one is
given, by digest alone.

**Code.** ``code_record`` records, for one component tree, the git commit of the
quantlab repository (and whether its tracked files had uncommitted changes), a
sha256 digest of the source file of every module that defines a class of the tree,
and the versions of the libraries whose behaviour decides a run's numbers. A
quantlab module outside the shipped implementations is a *framework* module: each
layer's root class and extension framework, such as ``quantlab.factor.polars`` or
``quantlab.portfolio.decision_inputs``. Every other recorded module is a
*component* module: the shipped implementations (``quantlab.<layer>.predefined``,
the datasets of ``quantlab.dataset``) and a user's own classes. Standard-library
and installed third-party modules are not recorded, nor a class without a source
file (one defined in a notebook); the libraries' versions are. ``dirty`` reports
uncommitted changes to tracked files only; ``git`` is ``None`` when quantlab is not
imported from a git working tree. A code comparison compares module digests and
library versions; the git commit is context only.

Nothing here raises on a difference: a run on changed data or code still runs.

class DataRecorder:
    """Record the data a run reads, hash it once per request, compare on close.

    A run opens one around everything it reads: a trained unit, a backtest
    run, a ``run_cv`` fold. While it is the innermost open recorder, every
    read through ``BaseDataset.panel`` and ``Factor.read`` is logged as a
    request; nested recorders log to the innermost only. Only leaf datasets
    record (a store or a held panel): a ``MergedDataset`` records nothing
    itself, its inputs do.

    When the context closes, each distinct request is read once more and
    hashed with ``_dataset_fingerprint`` over the requested variables (every
    variable of the panel when none were requested). ``records`` then maps each
    key to its requests, in the order first read; an in-memory dataset hashes
    the panel it holds. With ``expected`` given, the records are compared with
    it per key and request by ``digest`` alone; a changed, missing or extra
    request or key logs a warning showing the ranges and sizes as explanation,
    and nothing is raised.

    If the body raises, what was read so far is hashed and compared partially:
    a request or key not read yet is not reported, every warning carries
    ``_PARTIAL_NOTE``, and the original error propagates. The diagnostic never
    raises and never replaces that error: a failure of the hashing or the
    comparison itself only logs a warning, and ``records`` keeps what was
    hashed before it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    keys : iterable of (object, str) pairs, optional
        The key each dataset or factor is recorded under, matched by identity;
        a source given twice takes its first key. An unmapped source is
        recorded under ``"<ClassName>:<store path>"``, so two unmapped
        in-memory datasets share ``"FrameDataset:None"``; map them.
    expected : mapping, optional
        A ``records`` of an earlier run to compare with on close.
    owner : str
        The name that opens every warning.

    Attributes
    ----------
    records : dict
        ``{key: [entry, ...]}``, filled when the context closes. Each entry is
        a ``_dataset_fingerprint`` record plus ``request``: the first and last
        bar read (``start``, ``end``), the requested ``symbols`` and
        ``variables`` (``None`` for all).
