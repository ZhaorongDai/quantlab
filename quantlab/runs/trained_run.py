"""Trained runs: the files a training run leaves on disk, and how they are read back.

Training writes one directory per trained unit, a run of the run layer
(``quantlab.runs.directory``): it holds its files and, written last,
``run.json``, which describes the unit under the shared header. There are
three kinds:

- ``"model"``: one checkpoint, the ``config.json`` that rebuilds the model,
  and, when the fit was evaluated, the per-bar IC series ``ic_series.csv``
  and the test-segment predictions ``test_predictions.zarr``. ``run.json``
  holds the training window as configured and as fitted after the purge,
  the test window, what the model was trained on, the metrics and, for a
  library model that reports them, the hyperparameters the library actually
  trained with, ``resolved_hyperparameters``.
- ``"ensemble"``: its members, each a ``"model"`` unit in ``member_{k}/``,
  and the evaluation files of the combined prediction. ``run.json`` holds
  the members (directory and seed), the three windows and the metrics. Its
  load-mode checkpoint is its ``run.json``.
- ``"walk_forward"``: its folds, each a ``"model"`` or ``"ensemble"`` unit
  in ``fold_{i}/``. ``run.json`` holds the folds (directory, index, three
  windows, metrics) and the fold means of the metrics, ``cv_mean``.

Every unit's ``run.json`` also holds ``data_fingerprint``: what the unit's
``collect()`` read, as its ``DataRecorder`` recorded it, keyed by component
path within the model; and ``code``, the code record of the model
(``quantlab.utils.code_record``). Only the top unit records them: the trained
model, or the ensemble or walk-forward unit; its members and folds hold none.

``train`` writes a unit at ``{model_save_dir}/{Class}_trial_{timestamp}/``,
``train_cv`` a ``"walk_forward"`` unit there. Paths inside ``run.json`` are
relative to the unit, so a unit copied elsewhere still opens.

``TrainedRun.open`` (or ``quantlab.runs.directory.open_run``) is how a run
is read: from the unit's directory, its ``run.json``, or a model's
checkpoint; members and folds are opened with it, as child ``TrainedRun``
objects. A unit without ``run.json``, or written in another
``format_version``, is refused with a message to retrain it. The writing
functions are for the model layer.

This module imports no quantlab module outside ``quantlab.utils`` and the run
layer.

Examples
--------
>>> run = TrainedRun.open("models/MyHead_trial_20240601_120000_000000")
>>> run.kind, run.checkpoint.name
('model', 'MyHead_total.joblib')
>>> run.train_window, run.fitted_train_window

A walk-forward run opens the same way; its folds are units of their own:

>>> cv = TrainedRun.open("models/MyHead_trial_20240601_130000_000000")
>>> cv.kind, len(cv.folds), cv.folds[0].kind, cv.folds[0].index

        where a metric is undefined; empty when the fit was not evaluated

        The file ``load`` reads: a ``"model"`` unit's checkpoint, an

    data_fingerprint : dict
        What the unit's ``collect()`` read, by component path within the

        data their ensemble or walk-forward unit read.
    code : dict or None
        The code record of the model it trained (``git``, ``modules``,
        ``libraries``); None for a member or a fold.

        An ``"ensemble"`` unit's members, in member order; empty otherwise.

        A ``"walk_forward"`` unit's folds, in fold order; empty otherwise.
    cv_mean : dict or None
        A ``"walk_forward"`` unit's fold means, keyed ``cv_mean_{metric}``,
        with ``cv_n_folds``; empty when no fold has metrics, None for other
        kinds.
    index : int or None
        The fold's index in the walk, for a unit read as a fold.
