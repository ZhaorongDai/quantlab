"""Download US stock bars, quotes and trades from Alpaca Market Data.

``AlpacaAcquisition`` is the Alpaca-specific part of the acquisition layer.
It builds one HTTP request per page against Alpaca's historical stock
endpoints and hands each page to the shared ``Acquisition`` base class, which
handles pagination, resuming, concurrency, per-batch failures and writing the
raw parquet files (*shards*). Besides daily and minute *bars* (open, high,
low, close and volume per interval), Alpaca serves *tick* data: every
individual *quote* (best bid and ask) and *trade*.

Two data-quality terms matter here. *Survivorship bias* is the distortion
that comes from studying only companies that still exist today; a
*point-in-time* symbol list avoids it by naming each ticker as it was on each
date, including tickers later delisted. The module takes care never to let
Alpaca silently swap a delisted ticker for whatever company holds that
ticker today.

Credentials are read from ``APCA_API_KEY_ID`` and ``APCA_API_SECRET_KEY`` in
the environment and are never stored on a config or written to a log.
``ALPACA_SOURCE`` at the bottom of the module registers the vendor with
``quantlab.registry``.

class AlpacaAcquisition(Acquisition):
    """Download Alpaca Market Data through the shared ``Acquisition`` base.

    Alpaca serves many symbols per request and splits large answers into
    pages, so ``_fetch_page`` sends one request and returns
    ``(rows, next_page_token)``. The base class loops over the pages, writes
    the shards and keeps the page ledger.

    Data types. One value, returned by ``_data_type``, selects the endpoint,
    the field names and the shard columns. ``frequency="1d"`` and ``"1m"``
    fetch bars. ``frequency="tick"`` fetches ``quotes`` or ``trades`` and
    requires ``kwargs["data_type"]`` to say which, with no default. Tick rows
    are written exactly as received: nothing between the request and the
    shard resamples, groups or deduplicates them.

    Subscription tiers. Alpaca's free (Basic) plan and its paid Algo Trader
    Plus plan both serve history since 2016 with the same fields. The free
    plan withholds the latest 15 minutes, which a historical backfill never
    asks for. The difference that matters is the historical request rate:
    200 requests per minute on the free plan against 10,000 on the paid one,
    a factor of 50. At 200 per minute a full-market daily backfill takes
    about 8 minutes and a full-market minute backfill about 50 hours and
    358 GB. The practical question is therefore how much data a run asks
    for, and the volume check in ``quantlab.universe`` makes the user answer
    it before a run starts.

    Whether the free plan may use SIP data is unresolved. SIP (Securities
    Information Processor) is the consolidated feed covering every US
    exchange; IEX is a single exchange's feed. Alpaca's own documentation
    does not settle whether the free plan can request historical SIP data,
    and this class takes no position. One reading is yes, for data older
    than 15 minutes: the FAQ says ``end`` must be at least 15 minutes old to
    query SIP data without a subscription, and the plan table reads the same
    way. The other reading is IEX only: the data-sources table says IEX is
    the only feed available without a subscription. Three vendor pages
    support the first reading and one the second; that is a vote count, not
    evidence. The difference is material, because IEX carries roughly 2.5% of
    consolidated volume, and tick data limited to IEX would be unusable for
    research. So ``feed`` is a ``config.kwargs`` option with no in-code
    default: when it is unset the parameter is left out of the request and
    the vendor picks the best feed the account allows. Only a request made
    with a real key can settle the question.

    Corporate actions. This class has no corporate-actions method, endpoint
    or constant. If one is ever added it must not replace the delisting
    information in Tiingo's ``supported_tickers.csv``: Alpaca's Corporate
    Actions API leaves out delistings and reorganisations, and relying on it
    would bring back survivorship bias.

    Credentials. Only the market-data endpoints are used; there is no
    trading or broker API and no paper/live switch, because the market-data
    API does not distinguish the two. ``APCA_API_KEY_ID`` and
    ``APCA_API_SECRET_KEY`` are read from the environment inside
    ``_AlpacaMarketDataClient`` and are never put on a config, because
    ``AcquisitionConfig`` is saved as JSON beside model checkpoints and a
    key stored there would end up on disk. Their values are removed from
    every captured message.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : AcquisitionConfig
        The acquisition config. Alpaca-specific options go in
        ``config.kwargs``: ``data_type`` (required for ``frequency="tick"``),
        ``feed``, ``adjustment`` (default ``"raw"``), ``asof`` and
        ``page_limit`` (default 10,000), plus the base class's tuning
        parameters.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``data_type``, ``feed`` or ``adjustment`` is not an accepted
        value.
