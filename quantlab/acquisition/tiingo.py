"""Download daily (end-of-day) US stock prices from Tiingo.

``TiingoAcquisition`` is the Tiingo-specific part of the acquisition layer.
It asks Tiingo's daily price endpoint for one symbol's whole date range per
request and hands the rows to the shared ``Acquisition`` base class, which
handles resuming, concurrency, per-batch failures and writing the raw parquet
files (*shards*). Tiingo limits each account to a number of requests per hour
(its "request allocation", called the *quota* here); running out of it stops
the whole run rather than failing symbols one by one.

The API key is read from ``TIINGO_API_KEY`` in the environment and is never
stored on a config or written to a log. ``TIINGO_SOURCE`` at the bottom of
the module registers the vendor with ``quantlab.registry``.

class TiingoAcquisition(Acquisition):
    """Download Tiingo end-of-day prices through the shared ``Acquisition`` base.

    Tiingo's price endpoint takes one symbol per call and returns the whole
    requested date range in one response. So this vendor uses
    ``DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE = 1`` and ``_fetch_page`` never returns a page
    token; neither is a placeholder.

    Beyond building the request, this class decides what an error means. A
    429 from Tiingo means the account's hourly quota is used up, which
    affects every symbol. It is classified as ``"quota"``, and the base class
    stops sending work for the whole run instead of letting every remaining
    symbol fail in turn. ``AlpacaAcquisition`` treats the same status as a
    per-minute rate limit to wait out, which is why each vendor class
    declares its own status codes.

    Run options such as ``resume``, ``max_workers``, ``progress``,
    ``batch_size``, ``legacy_watermarks``, ``wait_for_quota``,
    ``quota_wait_seconds`` and ``quota_max_waits`` are read from
    ``config.kwargs``, so every run is reproducible from its config file.

    Credentials. ``TIINGO_API_KEY`` is read from the environment in the
    constructor and passed only to the in-memory ``TiingoClient``. It is
    never put on the config or on any attribute that could be serialised,
    and its value is removed from every captured message.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : AcquisitionConfig
        The acquisition config; ``frequency`` must be ``"1d"``.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``TIINGO_API_KEY`` is unset or empty.

    Examples
    --------
    Needs ``TIINGO_API_KEY`` exported; ``download()`` goes to the network::
