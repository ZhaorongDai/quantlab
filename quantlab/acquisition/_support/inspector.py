"""Read-only inspection of the data a source has already downloaded.

Each data source keeps two kinds of files on disk, called *tiers*. The raw
tier is the vendor's rows as downloaded, stored as parquet files (*shards*)
in a directory tree. The Zarr tier is the converted *panel*: an
``xarray.Dataset`` indexed by ``timestamp`` and ``symbol``, saved in the Zarr
format. Beside the raw tier sit small per-symbol JSON files (*watermark
sidecars*) recording which dates each symbol has been downloaded for, and a
failure manifest listing symbols whose downloads failed.

``SourceInspector`` answers questions about these files alone: which
requested symbols are already downloaded, which failed in earlier runs, how
many shards and sidecars exist, and a row-level view of either tier limited
to chosen symbols and dates. It imports no vendor client and never creates an
``Acquisition``, so it needs no API key and makes no network request,
whatever is called in whatever order. Listing the sources themselves is left
to ``quantlab.registry``, whose import loads every vendor module.

Nothing is cached on the instance. Every method builds its own coverage
ledger or opens its own store and closes it before returning, so one query
cannot restrict what a later query on the same inspector sees.
