"""Download of NYSE TAQ quote data from WRDS, and the shared WRDS connection.

WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services) is a university-run service that
serves licensed financial databases through a PostgreSQL server. One of them
is NYSE TAQ ("Trade and Quote"), which records every trade and quote on US
exchanges with millisecond timestamps or finer. This module downloads TAQ's
NBBO records. The NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer) is the highest bid and
the lowest ask across all US exchanges; TAQ stores one record each time
either side changes. WRDS stores one table per trading day, named
``taqm_{YYYY}.complete_nbbo_{YYYYMMDD}``.

The module holds three things. ``WrdsSession`` is the single read-only
database connection that every WRDS product in this package uses. It reads
the username from the ``WRDS_USERNAME`` environment variable and leaves the
password to libpq (the PostgreSQL client library), which reads it from the
``~/.pgpass`` file. It connects to a fixed WRDS host once per process,
because WRDS protects logins with Duo two-factor authentication and each new
connection can send a Duo prompt to the account holder's phone.

``WrdsTaqNbboAcquisition`` downloads the day tables. The work is split into
pages, and one page is one trading day for one batch of symbols, fetched
with a plain ``COPY (SELECT ... WHERE ...)``. Each NBBO record becomes one
row of the raw tier (the parquet files on disk), unfiltered and unsorted,
and the order in which the server sent the rows is kept in the
``wrds_row_ord`` column. ``WrdsNbboVolumeProbe`` counts the rows a download
would move, so that the volume guard (a check that estimates the size of a
download before it runs) can refuse one that is too large.

Sorting, de-duplicating and resampling the raw records happen later, in
``quantlab.dataset.nbbo``. The ``wrds`` package from PyPI is not used: its
connection asks for input interactively and it may open extra connections,
each of which can send a Duo prompt. The vendor's registry entry is defined
in ``quantlab.acquisition.wrds``, not in this file.

class WrdsSession:
    """A read-only PostgreSQL connection to WRDS, opened on first use.

    Constructing a session makes no network call. The connection opens on
    the first query and is reused for the rest of the process. Get the
    session through ``shared()`` rather than constructing one per batch,
    because each connection can send a Duo prompt and a WRDS account may hold
    only a few connections at once.

    The host, port and database are class constants passed directly to
    ``psycopg2.connect``, never read from a config or the environment, so no
    config file can send the credentials to another server. This code never
    handles the password: libpq reads it from ``~/.pgpass`` (or the file
    named by ``$PGPASSFILE``), and the session checks that the file has a
    matching entry before it tries to connect.

    The methods fall into three groups: pure SQL builders that need no
    connection (``table_identifier``, ``where_clause``, ``copy_query``,
    ``count_query``), general query helpers used by every WRDS product
    (``schema_usable``, ``fetch_rows``, ``copy_csv``), and TAQ-specific

    The work is split into pages, and one page is one trading day's table
    for one batch of symbols. ``_fetch_page`` reads the day named by the page
    token (the window's first trading day when there is no token) and
    returns the next trading day's ISO date as the next token. The shared
    ``Acquisition`` base class runs the batch loop, writes the parquet files
    (shards), records finished pages and resumes interrupted runs.

    The raw tier is written under ``.../wrds/data_type=nbbo/date=/symbol=/``
    (directories named ``key=value``, a layout called hive partitioning),
    with one row per NBBO record for the full trading day, unfiltered. The
    position at which each row arrived is stored as ``wrds_row_ord`` before
    anything else touches the frame, because before 2018 the tables have no
    sequence number and the server's order is the only way to order records
    with equal timestamps. TAQ's ``time_m`` is New York local clock time.
    ``timestamp`` is the same instant in UTC, stored without a time zone at
    nanosecond resolution, and the ``date=`` directory is the New York
    trading date.

    Symbols use a dot for share classes (``BRK.B``); the hyphenated form
