"""Download of CRSP daily stock data from WRDS, keyed by PERMNO.

CRSP (the Center for Research in Security Prices) publishes the standard
academic database of US stock prices and returns, including companies that
were later delisted, which avoids survivorship bias (the error of studying
only the companies that still exist today). WRDS (Wharton Research Data
Services) serves CRSP to subscribers through a PostgreSQL server. CRSP
identifies each security by its PERMNO, a permanent integer that never
changes and is never reused for another security, unlike a ticker symbol.

``WrdsCrspDailyAcquisition`` downloads ``crsp_a_stock.dsf_v2``, the CRSP
Stock v2 daily table, through the shared WRDS connection defined in
``quantlab.acquisition.wrds.taq``. The work is split into pages. One page is
one calendar year for one batch of PERMNOs, fetched with a plain
``COPY (SELECT ... WHERE permno = ANY(...) AND dlycaldt BETWEEN ...)``. The
rows are stored exactly as CRSP serves them, with no sorting, no
de-duplication and no derived or adjusted series. The raw data is keyed by
PERMNO rather than by ticker, because ``dsf_v2`` cannot tell share classes
apart by ticker and a company's ticker can change. The ticker is attached
later, when ``quantlab.dataset.crsp`` converts the raw data into a panel.

``CrspQueries`` builds the SQL statements (pure functions that can be tested
without a server) and hands them to the session. ``year_pages`` defines the
page boundaries.

``crsp_a_stock`` is CRSP's annual-update product: WRDS replaces it once a
year with a new release, called a vintage, that ends on a fixed last day. A
window that runs past that day is refused unless
``kwargs["clip_to_product_end"]`` is set. Each raw tier (the downloaded
parquet files) also records the vintage it was built from, so data from two
releases is never mixed.

class WrdsCrspDailyAcquisition(Acquisition):
    """Download CRSP Stock v2 daily bars from ``crsp_a_stock.dsf_v2``.

    The symbols of this acquisition are PERMNOs written as digit strings,
    for example ``"14593"`` (Apple). The work is split into pages, and one
    page is one calendar year for one batch of PERMNOs. ``_fetch_page`` reads
    the year named by the page token (the window's first year when there is
    no token) and returns the following year as the next token. The shared
    ``Acquisition`` base class runs the batch loop, writes the parquet files
    (shards), records finished pages and resumes interrupted runs.

    The raw tier is written under ``.../wrds_crsp/wrds/month=YYYY-MM/``, with
    one row per ``(permno, dlycaldt)`` exactly as CRSP serves it: no derived
    price, no adjusted series and no filtering. The ``symbol`` column holds
    the PERMNO as a string, and an ``Int64`` ``permno`` column is stored
    beside it. A page is refused, not repaired, when it repeats a key,
    contains a PERMNO that was not requested, or holds a row dated outside
    the page.

    Before any batch runs, the acquisition checks that every symbol is a
    PERMNO, that the account can read ``crsp_a_stock``, that the window does
    not extend past the last day of the current CRSP release (or clips it
    when ``kwargs["clip_to_product_end"]`` is set), and that the raw tier on
    disk was built from the same release. ``max_workers`` other than 1 is
    refused, because every WRDS connection can send a Duo two-factor prompt
    to the account holder's phone.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : AcquisitionConfig
