"""WRDS vendor package and the registry entry for a WRDS account.

WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services) is a university-run data service. One
WRDS login reaches several licensed data products through a PostgreSQL
server. This package downloads two of them, each with its own submodule and
acquisition class.

``quantlab.acquisition.wrds.taq`` downloads NYSE TAQ ("Trade and Quote")
millisecond data, specifically the NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer: the
highest bid and lowest ask across all US exchanges at each instant), through
``WrdsTaqNbboAcquisition``. ``quantlab.acquisition.wrds.crsp`` downloads CRSP
(Center for Research in Security Prices) Stock v2 daily bars through
``WrdsCrspDailyAcquisition``.

Both products log in the same way and share one database connection,
``taq.WrdsSession``. The session reads the username from the
``WRDS_USERNAME`` environment variable and leaves the password to the
PostgreSQL client library, which reads it from ``~/.pgpass``. WRDS protects
logins with Duo two-factor authentication, and each new connection can send
a Duo prompt to the account holder's phone, so the session is opened once
per process.

``WRDS_SOURCE`` registers this vendor with ``quantlab.registry``. It is a
single descriptor for the whole account, and each of its ``Capability`` rows
names the acquisition class and config factory of one product. The
descriptor lives here, not beside one of the two classes, because otherwise
one provider module would have to import the other to declare its
capability. The provider modules import nothing from the registry or from
this module.

Examples
--------
>>> from quantlab.acquisition.wrds import WRDS_SOURCE
>>> sorted((c.market, c.frequency, c.data_type)
...        for c in WRDS_SOURCE.capabilities)
[('us_equity', '1d', 'crsp_daily'), ('us_equity', 'tick', 'nbbo')]
>>> WRDS_SOURCE.required_env
('WRDS_USERNAME',)

#: The registered descriptor for the WRDS account.

#: The descriptor's own ``acquisition_cls`` and ``config_factory`` are the
#: vendor default (the TAQ product); ingest scripts read
#: ``SOURCE.acquisition_cls.DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`` from it. Each capability row
#: also names its own pair, so a request for ``crsp_daily`` resolves to the
#: CRSP class rather than to the default. ``display_name`` mentions both
#: products because choosing this source means choosing the account.
