"""Download of the CRSP, Compustat and CCM reference tables into ``_reference/``.

CRSP (the Center for Research in Security Prices) publishes the standard
database of US stock prices; Compustat publishes company fundamentals and
index membership; CCM (the CRSP/Compustat Merged database) links the two by
mapping Compustat company ids (gvkeys) to CRSP security ids (PERMNOs, the
permanent integer CRSP gives each security). All three are served by WRDS
(Wharton Research Data Services) through a PostgreSQL server.

Besides the daily prices, building a correct panel needs several lookup
tables: security names and tickers over time, delistings, distributions
(dividends and splits), and historical index membership. These are the
reference tables. ``quantlab.dataset.crsp.reference`` declares the six of
them (schema, column order and types) and reads them back without a
credential. ``CrspReferenceTables`` in this module does the download: it
copies each table whole through the shared WRDS session and writes one
parquet file per table, plus a ``manifest.json`` that records the CRSP
annual release (vintage) the tables came from.

This is deliberately not an ``Acquisition``. That base class downloads a
time series per symbol, in batches and pages, and records progress so it
can resume. These tables have no symbol axis and no date window; each one is
either present or not. They are written to ``.../wrds_crsp/_reference``,
beside the raw directory and never inside it, because the dataset's
conversion reads every file below the raw directory and a stray parquet or
manifest there would break it.

``stkdelists`` (delisting events) is stored as event data only. The daily
table already includes the delisting return on its own daily row, so nothing
here adds ``delret`` to ``dlyret``; doing so would count the delisting loss
twice.

class CrspReferenceTables:
    """Download the CRSP, Compustat and CCM reference tables into one directory.

    An instance holds only the shared session and the destination directory.
    The release, the index universes and whether to download again are
    arguments to ``pull``, so one instance can serve several releases.

    Several safety checks run, in this order. Every table is counted before
    it is copied, and refused if it has more than ``MAX_REFERENCE_ROWS``
    rows; because each table is copied whole, the count is the only guard
    against a renamed table turning into an unbounded download. The copy
    must then return exactly the counted number of rows. Each file is
    written to a temporary file in the destination directory and renamed
    into place. The manifest is written last, so an interrupted download
    never leaves a manifest naming a table it did not finish. Every value
    in SQL is a ``sql.Literal`` and every table or column name a
    ``sql.Identifier``.

    ----------
    session : WrdsSession
        The shared WRDS session.
    reference_dir : str or path-like
