"""The SQL statement that resamples TAQ NBBO records into bars on the WRDS server.

ADR 0027: over the slow link to WRDS, downloading every NBBO record and
resampling locally takes weeks for a decade of S&P 500 data, so the
resampling runs in SQL and only bars cross the network. ``NbboBarsQuery``
builds that statement for one day table and one batch of symbols. It
reproduces ``quantlab.dataset.nbbo.resample.NbboResampler`` step by step:

1. **Order.** ``row_number() OVER ()`` numbers the rows in the server's scan
   order before anything else touches them, the same assumption the tick
   path makes with ``wrds_row_ord``. Records are ordered by time (with
   ``time_m_nano`` from 2018 on), then by that number, which before 2018 is
   the only way to order records sharing a microsecond.
2. **Normalise.** A null or NaN price nulls its side and that side's size.
3. **Filter.** The rules of ``NbboFilterPolicy`` that are enabled, in its
   priority order (non-positive price, condition, crossed, locked); a
   dropped record is ignored completely and counted under its first
   matching rule. Records after the session close are dropped too.
4. **Bars.** Bar ``k`` covers ``(open + (k-1)d, open + kd]``; a record at or
   before the open falls in bar 0, the seed. The snapshot of bar ``k`` is
   the last kept record at or before its end, so records sharing an instant
   collapse to the last one and a bar with no update carries the quote in
   force. ``n_updates`` counts every kept record inside bar ``k``, tied ones
   included; ``n_ambiguous_ties`` counts those of them whose instant holds
   more than one distinct (bid, bid size, ask, ask size) state, so identical
   duplicates count zero.
5. **Time weights.** After ties collapse, each quote is in force from its
   instant (the seed from the open) to the next quote or the close. Each
   such span is cut at the bar edges; ``tw_spread``, ``tw_bid_size`` and
   ``tw_ask_size`` of bar ``k`` are the sum of value times duration over
   the pieces in bar ``k`` where the value is defined, divided by the sum of
   their durations, and NULL when the value was never defined in the bar.
6. **Grid.** Every ``(ticker, k)`` for ``k = 1..N`` is returned for every
   ticker with a record that day, also when all its records were dropped,
   so the result has exactly ``tickers x N`` rows. ``page_rows``, the row
   count the server computed, is on every row, so the client can tell a
   truncated transfer from a complete one.
7. **Filter counts.** The ``FILTER_STATS_COUNTS`` of each ticker over all its
   records of the day, as ``NbboResampler.resample_with_stats`` counts them,
   are set on the ticker's bar 1 row and NULL on its other rows.

Steps 4 and 5 share one ordering of the kept records by ticker, time and
scan order: a record is the last at its instant when the next record is
later, and the last in its bar when the next record is in a later bar, so
the server sorts the day's records once. Only records sharing their instant
with a neighbour are grouped by instant for ``n_ambiguous_ties``, and only
quotes in force across a bar edge are split into pieces per bar.

Times are compared as nanoseconds since midnight on TAQ's ``time_m`` clock
(New York); the client computes the session bounds from the XNYS calendar
and passes them in, so the server needs no calendar. The bar labels are
computed by the client from ``k``. ``mid``, ``spread``, ``spread_bps`` and
``imbalance`` are derived by the client from the snapshot. An instant holds
several states when, in any of the four columns, its records hold more than
one distinct value or mix null and non-null ones; values are compared as
numbers, never through their text form.

Every value enters the statement as a ``psycopg2.sql.Literal`` and every
name as a ``psycopg2.sql.Identifier``; nothing is pasted in as text. The
statement is always restricted by the ``(sym_root, sym_suffix)`` pairs
condition of ``WrdsSession.where_clause``, so it never scans a whole day
table.
