"""Massive client: one trading day's file from S3, and the trade-condition table over REST.

Massive (Stocks Developer, personal use) serves every SIP trade and its own
minute and day aggregates as one gzipped CSV per data type and trading day
in the S3 bucket ``flatfiles`` at ``files.massive.com`` (ADR 0030), and
reference data over REST at ``api.massive.com``. ``MassiveClient`` makes a
day's file present and verified in the raw tier
(``quantlab.dataset.massive.raw``) and stores the condition table beside
it, so a conversion needs no network.

Credentials come from the environment only: ``MASSIVE_API_KEY`` (REST, and
the S3 secret unless ``MASSIVE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` is set) and
``MASSIVE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID``. A missing one fails when the client is made,
before any transfer, naming the variables. The API key travels in an
``Authorization`` header, never in a URL a log could print.

Two seams carry every transfer, and tests replace both: the *object store*
(``size`` of a key and ``read`` of a byte range; the default signs S3
requests with boto3) and ``http_get`` (one REST GET; the default is
``rest_get``). The client tells three failures apart:
``MassiveNotPublishedError`` (no file for that day: a holiday, or today
before the vendor publishes), ``MassiveEntitlementError`` (the key was
refused, or the day is outside the plan's window) and
``MassiveTransportError`` (the network, throttling included), which alone is
retried after a back-off that doubles on each attempt.

A file is downloaded in ``streams`` byte ranges of ``part_bytes`` at once, each
written at its offset of ``<name>.part``; a range whose stream breaks is
asked again for only the bytes it still lacks. The whole file is then
checked against the vendor's size and decoded to the end of its gzip, and
only then renamed into place. ``download_days`` runs over the XNYS sessions
of a date range, oldest first, with several files in flight, and records a
watermark per data type, so an interrupted run resumes where it stopped.
One file is fetched at a time, with all ``streams``, while up to
``files - 1`` earlier ones are being verified: decoding a day of trades
takes a core about twice as long as fetching it (``docs/massive.md`` lists
the measured rates).

Examples
--------
Needs the credentials and the network::

    client = MassiveClient()
    client.condition_table("/data/quantlab/downloads")
    client.download_day("trades", date(2024, 11, 29), "/data/quantlab/downloads")
    for day in client.download_days("minute_aggs", date(2016, 10, 11), date(2016, 12, 30),
                                     "/data/quantlab/downloads"):
        print(day.day, day.published)

        ahead: a day is started only once the caller has moved past the day
        ``files`` before it, so however slow the caller, the day it holds and
        at most ``files - 1`` after it are on disk. Only XNYS sessions are asked for: weekends and holidays are
        not. A session Massive has no file for (not published yet) is
        yielded unpublished and skipped. Each published day moves the data
        type's watermark to it (``raw.read_watermark``) while no earlier day
        of the run is missing, and a later run starts after the watermark:
        a day not published yet holds it, so a later run asks for that day
        again. The watermark says what was downloaded, not what was
        converted; a caller converting the files keeps its own record.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data_type : str
            ``"trades"``, ``"minute_aggs"`` or ``"day_aggs"``.
        start, end : date
            The first and last day, inclusive; days on or before the
            watermark are left out.
        download_root : str or Path
            The download directory; the files land under its ``massive/``.

        Yields
        ------
        DayDownload
            One per XNYS session after the watermark, in date order.

        Raises
        ------
        MassiveEntitlementError
            If Massive refused the credentials or a day; the run stops, and
            the watermark stays on the last day before it.
        MassiveTransportError
            If a transfer kept failing; likewise.
