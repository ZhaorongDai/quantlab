"""Massive vendor package and the registry entry for a Massive subscription.

The client lives in ``quantlab.acquisition.massive.client``; this package
module holds only the descriptor, as ``quantlab.acquisition.sharadar`` does,
so importing the client also registers the source.

``MASSIVE_SOURCE`` registers Massive (Stocks Developer) with
``quantlab.acquisition.registry`` so an operator surface lists it: one
``Capability`` per data type of the raw tier (``quantlab.dataset.massive.raw.DATA_TYPES``),
the credential variables, and the dataset class that builds Trade bars from
the trade files (ADR 0030). The minute and day aggregates are raw only: they
are kept to check Trade bars against.

Massive's raw tier is one vendor file per data type and trading day, pulled by
``MassiveClient``, not the symbol-batched hive tree an ``Acquisition``
writes. The descriptor therefore names no acquisition class and no config
factory: ``registry.run()`` refuses it, and the download is the client's
(a backfill script under ``scripts/massive/`` is planned).

Examples
--------
>>> import quantlab.acquisition.registry
>>> from quantlab.acquisition.base import DataSourceRegistry
>>> source = DataSourceRegistry.get("massive")
>>> [c.data_type for c in source.capabilities]
['trades', 'minute_aggs', 'day_aggs']
>>> source.required_env
('MASSIVE_API_KEY', 'MASSIVE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
