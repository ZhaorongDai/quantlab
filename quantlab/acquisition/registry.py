"""Registry of every data source quantlab can download from.

A data source is one vendor, such as Tiingo, Alpaca or WRDS. Each vendor is
described once by a ``SourceDescriptor``: the names of the environment
variables that hold its credentials, the ``Acquisition`` class that downloads
from it, and the ``Capability`` rows it actually serves. A capability is one
``(market, frequency, data_type)`` combination, for example US equities at
daily frequency.

Downloading and converting are two separate steps. An acquisition writes a
raw tier: the vendor's data as parquet files on disk, plus small watermark
files that record how far each symbol has been downloaded so that a later run
can resume. A dataset class then converts the raw tier into a Zarr store
holding a panel, an ``xarray.Dataset`` indexed by ``timestamp`` and
``symbol``. The module-level functions ``run()`` and ``convert()`` perform
these two steps without the caller naming any vendor class.

Descriptors register themselves by calling ``register_source``
(``quantlab.acquisition.base``) beside the acquisition class they describe,
which adds them to ``DataSourceRegistry``. The vendor modules are imported at
the bottom of this file and never import it, so
``import quantlab.acquisition.registry`` alone makes every source available.

Descriptors hold environment variable names only. No function here returns,
logs or embeds a credential value, not even a masked one, and no descriptor
holds a base URL or host.

Examples
--------
>>> import quantlab.acquisition.registry
>>> from quantlab.acquisition.base import DataSourceRegistry
>>> [d.vendor for d in DataSourceRegistry.all()]

    vendor clients apply when they are constructed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    descriptor : SourceDescriptor
        The source to check.

    Returns

    """Download a raw tier in the current process and return the outcome.

    The acquisition class is looked up from the descriptor's capability for
    ``(config.market, config.frequency, config.kwargs["data_type"])``, so the
    caller never names a vendor class. Constructing that class is the first
    point at which a credential is required. The run writes raw parquet files
    (shards) and watermark files and stops there; converting them to Zarr is
    the separate ``convert()`` step.

    Parameters
    ----------
    descriptor : SourceDescriptor
        The source to download from.
    config : AcquisitionConfig
        What to download; its ``market``, ``frequency`` and optional
        ``kwargs["data_type"]`` pick the capability.
    refresh : bool, default False
        If True, call ``refresh()``, which downloads the covered window
        again. Otherwise call ``download()``, which fills only what is
        missing.
    reporter : ProgressReporter or None, default None
        Receives a ``ProgressEvent`` per batch. ``None`` keeps the default
        progress bar on stderr.
    cancel : CancelToken or None, default None
        Setting the token stops the run at the next batch boundary.
        Completed batches stay on disk, and a later call resumes from them.

    Returns
    -------
    AcquisitionResult
        The result the acquisition stored on its ``last_result`` attribute.
        Its ``failures`` are the ones this run met. The failure manifest on
        disk (a JSON file of failed symbols) accumulates across runs and may
        name more symbols; read it through ``SourceInspector.failures``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError

        scripts download it.

    This is the second step after ``run()``. It reads the raw parquet tier
    and writes the store through the capability's ``dataset_cls``, one time
    window at a time. It uses no vendor client and no credential. The
    capability is looked up by ``(dataset_config.market,
    dataset_config.frequency, data_type)``.

    No memory check runs here. A window too large for memory fails with an
    out-of-memory error, so choose the window size (``granularity``)
    yourself. ``predicted_peak_bytes`` is only copied into the result for
    reporting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    descriptor : SourceDescriptor
        The source whose raw tier is being converted.
    dataset_config : DatasetConfig
        Where the raw tier is and where the store goes.
    data_type : str or None, default None
        Picks one capability when the vendor serves several at this
        ``(market, frequency)``.
    granularity : str, default "year"
        Length of each conversion window, such as ``"year"`` or
        ``"quarter"``.
    on_new_listing : str, default "refuse"
        What to do with a symbol that is not on the store's fixed symbol
        axis; passed to ``from_raw_data_chunked``.
    predicted_peak_bytes : int or None, default None
        The caller's own memory estimate, copied into the result.
    reporter : ProgressReporter or None, default None
        Receives a ``ProgressEvent`` per window.
    cancel : CancelToken or None, default None
        Checked between windows. Windows already written stay in the store
        and in its record of finished windows, so a later call with the same
        config resumes at the first unwritten window and reports
        ``resumed=True``.

    Returns
    -------
    ConversionResult
        The result the dataset stored on ``last_chunk_result``, with
        ``predicted_peak_bytes`` filled in.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        In three cases: the descriptor serves no such capability (the
        message lists what it does serve); several capabilities match with
        different dataset classes (pass ``data_type``); or the matching
        capability has no ``dataset_cls``, because its data is a stream of
        irregularly timed events that no panel can hold.

    --------
