"""Markowitz mean-variance weights with a turnover penalty, solved with cvxpy.

``MeanVarianceOptimizer`` maximises, on every rebalance bar,

over long-only, fully invested weights, or dollar-neutral long-short
weights of gross exposure at most one, under a per-symbol cap. The expected
return ``mu`` is calibrated from a label's prediction (Grinold: ``ic *

comes from a covariance estimator, its volatilities optionally from a volatility
label's prediction, and all are on the span of the expected-return label.

    On each rebalance bar the candidates are the symbols the context marks
    tradable, covered by the covariance estimator (enough recent return history), and
    either with a finite prediction of ``expected_return_label`` or held; a
    held candidate without a prediction has an expected return of 0.0, so
    its turnover cost decides whether it is closed. A locked position (held,
    not tradable) keeps its current weight; a held, tradable symbol the risk
    model does not cover is closed, and the row reports it in
    ``attrs["events"]["closed_without_risk"]``; every other symbol gets 0.0.
    Over the candidates the optimiser solves

        maximise    w @ mu - risk_aversion / 2 * w @ Sigma @ w
                    - turnover_penalty * |w - w_current|_1

    subject to, with ``direction="long_only"``,

        sum(w) = 1,  0 <= w <= weight_cap

    and with ``direction="long_short"``,

        sum(w) = 0,  |w|_1 <= 1,  |w| <= weight_cap.

    ``w`` in the risk term also holds the locked weights, so their
    covariance with the candidates counts, while the turnover and the cap
    apply to the candidates only; the budget is what the locked positions
    leave: the candidates sum to ``1 - L`` long-only (nothing when ``L >=
    1``) and to ``-L`` long-short with ``|w|_1 <= 1 - |L|_1``, ``L`` the
    locked weights. A locked position the covariance estimator does not cover adds no
    variance. The long-short gross exposure is a ceiling, not an
    equality: when the expected returns do not pay for the risk and the
    turnover, part of the book stays uninvested, down to no position at all.

    ``Sigma`` is the covariance estimator's one-bar covariance times the span ``n`` of
    ``expected_return_label`` (variance is linear in time). When the risk
    model's estimate has a factor form (``B F B' + diag(D)``), the risk term
    is built as ``|F^(1/2) B' w|^2 + w' diag(D) w`` and the dense matrix is
    never formed. ``mu`` depends on ``calibration``: ``"grinold"`` (the
    default) gives ``mu = ic * sigma * z``, ``sigma`` the square root of
    ``Sigma``'s diagonal and ``z`` the candidates' cross-sectional z-score
    (``ddof=1``) of the prediction over the predicted candidates, so the
    prediction only ranks and any
    model's output can feed the optimiser; ``"raw"`` takes the prediction
    itself as ``mu``, which ``bind`` allows only when the label's spec
    reports its scale as ``"raw"``. ``w_current`` is the context's current
    weights.

    With ``volatility_label`` set (a ``Volatility`` label, say), the
    volatilities come from a model: the label's prediction at the bar,
    divided by ``sqrt(n)``, is handed to the covariance estimator as the one-bar
    volatilities, so ``Sigma`` is the predicted volatilities around the risk
    model's historical correlations, its diagonal the squared predictions,
    and the Grinold ``sigma`` is the prediction itself. A symbol without a
    finite positive volatility prediction has no risk estimate, like one
    without enough history. ``bind`` requires the label to have the span of
    ``expected_return_label`` and a ``"raw"`` scale.

    With ``candidate_top_k`` set, only a pool is optimised: the
    ``candidate_top_k`` candidates with the largest ``mu`` (largest ``|mu|``
    long-short) plus every candidate currently held, so a held symbol that
    fell out of the top can still be closed at its turnover cost. The
    z-score is taken over every candidate before the pool is cut.

    The solver's solution is cleaned of its round-off: projected onto the
    feasible set long-only (the nearest weights summing to one within
    ``[0, weight_cap]``), clipped and rescaled to dollar neutrality and a
    gross exposure of at most one long-short.

    A bar whose candidates cannot hold their budget under ``weight_cap``, a
    long-short bar whose locked positions exceed a gross exposure of one,
    a bar the solver fails on or leaves unsolved (bounds the candidates
    cannot reach among them), and a bar with a locked position lacking a
    bounded exposure raise ``PortfolioConstructionError``: the backtest holds
    the current position there and records the bar.

    Two extension points let a rule built on the optimiser change what risk
    means: ``reference_weights`` (the risk term prices ``w - b`` against a
    reference book, a benchmark say) and ``risk_constraints`` (constraints
    on the risk term, a tracking-error cap say). Both are unused by default,
    and the problem is then exactly the one above. ``scripts/active_risk.py``
    builds a benchmark-relative rule on them.

    ``declared_inputs()`` is the covariance estimator's declaration (its
    return window, its factor risk model) merged with the
    ``exposure_factors``, whose outputs must not repeat a name.
    ``exposure_bounds`` may bound any of their outputs or any of the risk
    model's ``exposure_names`` (read from ``context.risk_exposures``); a
    bounded name must come from one of the two, not both.
    ``bind`` reads the span from the label's ``LabelSpec``, so a backtest
    binds the optimiser when it is built.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : MeanVarianceConfig
        ``expected_return_label``, ``covariance``, ``risk_aversion``,
        ``calibration``, ``ic``, ``turnover_penalty``, ``weight_cap``,
        ``direction``, ``candidate_top_k``, ``volatility_label``,
        ``exposure_factors``, ``exposure_bounds`` and ``solver``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``direction`` or ``calibration`` is unknown, ``ic`` is missing
        for ``"grinold"``, ``weight_cap`` is not in ``(0, 1]``,
        ``risk_aversion`` or ``turnover_penalty`` is negative,
        ``candidate_top_k`` is not a positive integer, or ``solver`` is not
        an installed cvxpy solver.

    Examples
    --------
    ``specs`` holds the spec of a 5-bar ``ret_5`` label
    (``LabelSpec("ret_5", "raw", 1, 5)``); ``context`` is a bar of four
    symbols ``AAA``..``DDD``, all tradable and none held, with 60 bars of
    one-bar returns of volatility 1%, 1.5%, 2% and 2.5% and ``ret_5``
    predictions 0.8, -0.1, -0.3 and 0.2. With a risk aversion of 5 on so small
    an expected return the book leans toward the low-volatility symbols:

    >>> from quantlab.portfolio.config import LedoitWolfEstimatorConfig, MeanVarianceConfig
    >>> from quantlab.portfolio.predefined.ledoit_wolf import LedoitWolfEstimator
    >>> optimizer = MeanVarianceOptimizer(MeanVarianceConfig(
    ...     expected_return_label="ret_5",
    ...     covariance=LedoitWolfEstimator(LedoitWolfEstimatorConfig(lookback_bars=60)),
    ...     ic=0.05, risk_aversion=5.0, weight_cap=0.4,
    ... ))
    >>> optimizer.declared_inputs().lookback_bars
    60
    >>> optimizer.bind(specs)
    >>> weights = optimizer.construct(context)
    >>> float(weights.sum().round(6)), bool((weights >= 0).all()), bool((weights <= 0.4).all())
    (1.0, True, True)

    Long-short on the same bar the book is dollar-neutral, and its gross
    exposure (0.946) stays under the ceiling of one:

    >>> long_short = MeanVarianceOptimizer(MeanVarianceConfig(
    ...     expected_return_label="ret_5",
    ...     covariance=LedoitWolfEstimator(LedoitWolfEstimatorConfig(lookback_bars=60)),
    ...     ic=0.05, risk_aversion=5.0, weight_cap=0.4, direction="long_short",
    ... ))
    >>> long_short.bind(specs)
    >>> weights = long_short.construct(context)
    >>> weights.values.round(3)
    array([ 0.4  , -0.212, -0.261,  0.073])

    With ``DDD`` held at 0.3 and halted, it is a locked position: it keeps
    its weight and the candidates share the remaining 0.7:

    >>> import dataclasses
    >>> halted = dataclasses.replace(
    ...     context,
    ...     tradable=context.tradable.copy(data=[True, True, True, False]),
    ...     current_weights=context.current_weights.copy(data=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3]),
    ... )
