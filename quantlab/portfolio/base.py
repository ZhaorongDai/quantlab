"""The root classes of portfolio construction: the rule from one bar's scores to weights.

A *portfolio construction* rule turns the scores of one bar, and the weights
currently held, into the weights to hold after that bar (ADR 0012). Every
rule derives from ``PortfolioConstructor``, whose one abstract method,
``construct(context)``, is handed a ``PortfolioContext`` holding only what is
known at that bar. ``decide`` runs ``construct``, checks the row and holds
a bar the rule cannot solve. A rule only decides: its contexts are
assembled by ``quantlab.portfolio.decision_inputs.DecisionInputs``, for the
vectorised backtest (a whole panel, the holdings replayed between
rebalances) and for an event-driven executor (one bar, with the holdings it
really has).

The output follows the weights contract (D-03): on a rebalance bar every
symbol gets a finite weight, an unselected one exactly 0.0, with gross
exposure at most one; an all-NaN row means "hold the current position". A
*locked position*, a symbol held but not tradable at the bar, keeps its
current weight, and a symbol neither tradable nor held gets 0.0 (ADR 0014);
the loop checks both. A rule holds no state between bars. A bar the rule
cannot solve raises ``PortfolioConstructionError``, and the loop holds it
instead.

A *covariance estimator* (``CovarianceEstimator``) estimates the covariance
of one-bar returns at a bar, as a ``CovarianceEstimate``; a rule that prices
risk, such as a mean-variance optimiser, holds one. It is not a factor risk
model (``quantlab.risk``), which is estimated ahead as stores; one estimator,
``FactorRiskStoreEstimator``, reads those stores: its estimate is the
model's forecast (``quantlab.risk.base.FactorRiskForecast``), whose
``factor_form()`` lets an optimiser build a low-rank risk term, and it
declares its risk model, whose exposures at the bar the decision inputs take
from the model itself (read or computed per its ``exposure_data_strategy``)
and put in each bar's context.

What a rule reads at each bar besides its predictions and holdings is one
value, its ``InputDeclaration`` (``declared_inputs()``): the return window
and the prices behind it, the ``Factor`` panels, the factor risk model. A
rule holding a covariance estimator merges the estimator's into its own.

Shipped rules and covariance estimators live in
``quantlab/portfolio/predefined``; this module imports no solver.

    timestamp : pd.Timestamp
        The bar the rule decides on; the weights it returns fill at the next
        bar.
    predictions : xr.Dataset
        Every label's prediction at the bar: one variable per label name, in
        the predictor's label order, on ``symbol``.
    tradable : xr.DataArray
        Booleans on ``symbol``: whether the symbol can be traded at the bar,
        judged from nothing later than the bar (the price dataset's
        ``tradable_bars``: by default, a real fill price at the bar). A rule
        treats a symbol without a finite prediction of the label it reads as
        not selectable too.
    current_weights : xr.DataArray
        The weights currently held, on ``symbol``, valued at this bar's
        valuation price: what the orders of the earlier rebalances left,
        rejected orders and delisting settlements included; 0.0 where
        nothing is held, all 0.0 before the first rebalance.
    returns : xr.DataArray or None
        The trailing window of one-bar returns ending at the bar, on
        ``(timestamp, symbol)``, of the rule's declared ``lookback_bars``
        length (no bars for a rule that needs none), read from its last
        declared ``history_bars`` raw valuation prices up to and including
        the bar.
        Each return is computed from the last valuation price known at its
        bar within those, so a halt shows as zero returns and then the whole
        gap on the bar the symbol trades again; NaN before a symbol's first
        price in them and on that price's bar. ``None`` in a
        context built by hand for a rule that reads none.
    staleness : xr.DataArray or None
        Bars since each symbol's last real valuation price within the
        rule's last declared ``history_bars`` bars, on ``symbol``: 0 when it has one
        at the bar, NaN when it has none in those bars. ``None`` without
        prices.
    factors : xr.Dataset or None
        The values at the bar of the ``Factor`` panels the rule declares
        (``InputDeclaration.factors``; a benchmark beta, for example): one variable
        per factor name, on ``symbol``, NaN where a symbol has none.
        ``None`` when the rule declares none.
    risk_exposures : xr.Dataset or None
        The exposures at the bar of the factor risk model the rule declares
        (``InputDeclaration.risk_model``), as ``FactorRiskModel.exposures`` gives
        them (read from the exposures factor's store or computed, per the
        model's ``exposure_data_strategy``): its ``exposure_names`` and

    (Ledoit-Wolf), or reads a forecast stored ahead (a factor risk model's

        Called once when a backtest is constructed, before any data is read

        ``DecisionInputs.from_run`` with the specs a run's prediction panel

        context : PortfolioContext
            What is known at the bar.

        Returns
        -------
        xr.DataArray
            One weight per symbol of ``context.symbols``, on ``symbol``:
            finite, 0.0 where nothing is held, gross exposure at most one;

        bug in the rule, not a hold, and raises. ``decide`` is not meant to
        be overridden: a rule implements ``construct``.

        ----------

            The weights on ``context.symbols`` (all NaN to hold), the failure

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If ``construct`` returns weights on other symbols than the
