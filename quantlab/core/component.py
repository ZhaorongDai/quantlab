"""The component rule: how a configurable object is serialised and rebuilt.

A *component* is an object built from one config dataclass: a dataset, a
factor, a label. Some config fields hold other components (a factor's
dataset, a label's factor, a merged dataset's inputs). Those fields are
declared on the config dataclass with ``component()``, next to the fields
themselves, and that one declaration drives both directions:

- ``config_to_dict`` writes a config as a plain dict, each declared field
  replaced by its component's own ``get_config()``, whose ``"name"`` is the
  component class's import path;
- ``Component.from_config(d, run_dir=None)`` rebuilds the declared fields
  first, recursing only along them, then constructs the object from the
  config class its class declares in ``config_cls``. ``run_dir``, the run
  directory the dict was read from, reaches every level.

Nothing is recognised by key name or by shape: a free-form dict field (a
factor's ``kwargs``) is never entered, even when it holds a ``"name"`` key.

The same declarations give the component tree: ``walk_components`` yields
every component under a root with its path of field names, and inside
``recorded_configs`` a component found in a declared field is written as the
config recorded for it instead of its own ``get_config()`` (a run directory
records an in-memory dataset reading its copy under the run).
Only a class that declares a config class is ever rebuilt, so a saved dict
cannot instantiate an arbitrary importable callable.

Examples
--------
With ``momentum`` a ``Momentum`` factor over a ``SpotKlineDataset``:

>>> from quantlab.base.config import ForwardConfig
>>> from quantlab.label.forward import Forward
>>> label = Forward(ForwardConfig(factor=momentum, span=5))
>>> saved = label.get_config()
>>> saved["factor"]["name"], saved["factor"]["dataset"]["name"]
('quantlab.factor.predefined.momentum.Momentum', 'quantlab.dataset.spot.SpotKlineDataset')
>>> rebuild(saved) == label
True
