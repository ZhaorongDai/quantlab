"""A shared store's folder: the store, a README.md and the component that writes it.

A shared store lives in its own folder, ``<category>/<group>/<stem>/<stem>.zarr`` under
the data root, beside a short ``README.md`` and ``component.json``: the ``get_config()``
of the dataset, factor or factor risk model that writes it. ``load_component`` rebuilds
that component from the folder alone (``quantlab.core.component.rebuild``), which is how
the daily data update (``scripts/data_update/update.py``) updates or extends a store
without the recipe that defined it.

    The config is checked first: it is written to JSON and rebuilt, and the rebuilt
    component must equal ``component``. A component that cannot come back from its config
    (a dataset held in memory has no store to read back) is refused before anything is
    written. The folder is created as needed; an existing README.md is kept unless
    ``readme`` is given.

    Parameters
    ----------
    component : Component
        The dataset, factor or factor risk model that writes the folder's store.
    folder : str or pathlib.Path
        The store's folder.
    readme : str, optional
        What the store is, which recipe defines it, what reads it.

    Returns
    -------
    pathlib.Path
        The written ``component.json``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the component does not rebuild equal from its config.
