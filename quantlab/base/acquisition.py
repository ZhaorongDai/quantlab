"""Download raw vendor data into a local tree of parquet files.

``Acquisition`` is the abstract base class every data-vendor client
subclasses. A subclass declares ``VENDOR`` and ``RAW_COLUMNS`` and implements
``_fetch_page``, which issues one request and returns one page of rows. The
base class supplies everything around that request: splitting the symbol list
into batches, following pagination, fetching batches concurrently on worker
threads, isolating a failure to the batch that caused it, stopping the whole
run when the vendor's request quota runs out, honouring a caller's cancel
request, reporting progress, and removing credentials from every captured
error message.

A few terms recur throughout the module. A *shard* is one parquet file
holding the rows of one page for one partition. Shards are laid out as a
*hive* tree, where each directory level is named ``key=value`` (for example
``month=2024-01/part-....pqt``), so a reader can skip whole directories by
key. A *watermark* is the last date a symbol is known to be downloaded
through; it is stored in a small per-symbol JSON file called a *sidecar*,
which lets ``refresh()`` fetch only what is missing. The *page ledger*
records which pages of a batch have landed, so an interrupted batch resumes
from the next page instead of starting over.

This layer writes raw files only. Converting them into the project's
canonical panel, an ``xarray.Dataset`` indexed by ``timestamp`` and
``symbol``, is the matching dataset class's job. Coverage bookkeeping lives
in ``quantlab.base.coverage``, the page ledger in ``quantlab.base.pageledger``
and progress events in ``quantlab.base.progress``.

    ``set(failures)`` is a subset of both ``requested`` and the manifest's

class Acquisition(ABC):
    """Abstract base for config-driven, resumable raw-data downloads.

    A subclass declares ``VENDOR`` and ``RAW_COLUMNS`` and implements
    ``_fetch_page``. The base class turns that single request into a
    concurrent, resumable run over the config's symbol list, in which one
    failing batch does not stop the others. It writes parquet shards under
    ``config.raw_data_dir_path`` in a hive layout whose keys depend on the
    data frequency. It never touches xarray or Zarr; the matching dataset
    class converts these raw files into the canonical panel.

    ``download()`` backfills ``[config.start_date, config.end_date]`` for
    every requested symbol. ``refresh()`` fetches each symbol forward from its
    own watermark, so repeated calls do not re-fetch history. Both skip
    symbols whose sidecar already covers the requested window.

    Each symbol's sidecar lives under ``config.watermark_path`` and holds
    ``last_date``, optionally ``start_date`` and optionally ``no_data``.
    ``start_date`` is where the downloaded range begins. When it is missing
    the start is unknown and is never guessed; ``stamp_watermarks`` fills it
    in. ``no_data`` means the vendor was asked about the symbol over that
    window and returned nothing. That is different from a failed fetch (an
    entry in the failure manifest and no sidecar) and from a symbol that was
    never fetched (neither). Both optional keys are omitted rather than
    written as false, so sidecars written before these keys existed still
    read back correctly.

    Per-run tuning parameters are read from ``config.kwargs``: ``batch_size``,
    ``max_workers``, ``resume``, ``progress``, ``wait_for_quota``,
    ``quota_wait_seconds``, ``quota_max_waits``, ``legacy_watermarks``,
    ``rate_limit_backoff_seconds`` and ``rate_limit_max_retries``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : AcquisitionConfig
        The acquisition config. ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` are
        filled with open-ended defaults when left ``None``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    last_result : AcquisitionResult or None
        The outcome of the most recent ``download()`` or ``refresh()``, or
        ``None`` before either has run.

    Examples
    --------
    A minimal vendor client, where ``client`` stands for the vendor's own

        ``_write_failure_manifest`` rewrites the whole file and each run
        starts with an empty dict. Without this step, a run that stopped
        before reaching a symbol that failed last time, or that asked for a
        different list of symbols, would erase the only record that the
        symbol is still failing. Symbols in ``attempted`` (succeeded or
        failed this run) are not restored: a success must leave the manifest,
        and a failure already carries this run's message.

        ``failures`` is the manifest copy, not the run's own dict, so the
        run's ``AcquisitionResult`` never gains symbols it did not touch. The
        cost is that an entry for a symbol that left the universe stays until
        it is removed by hand, which is the smaller harm.

        Parameters
        ----------
        failures : dict[str, str]
            The manifest copy, updated in place.

        The file is rewritten whole, but the caller has already merged in the

        record across runs. A failed symbol has no watermark, so the next run
        fetches it again and it reappears here if it fails again. The write
        is atomic because a cancel makes the run rewrite this file on its way
        out, and a truncated manifest would silently list fewer symbols.

        This is the one method every subclass must implement. ``rows`` is a

        ``symbol`` and ``vendor``. ``_write_shard`` reduces it to

        layout the matching dataset class expects. A ``None`` token means
        this was the last page for ``symbols``; a vendor without pagination
        simply returns ``None`` every time. Implementations must not touch

        Parameters
        ----------
        symbols : list[str]
            The batch to request.

        page_token : str | None, default None
            The token the previous page returned, or ``None`` for
            the first page.

        -------
        tuple[polars.DataFrame, str or None]
            The page's rows and the token for the next page, or ``None``
