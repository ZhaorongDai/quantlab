"""Time-window planning and the resume ledger for chunked ingestion.

*Chunked ingestion* converts raw vendor data into a Zarr store one time
window at a time. Each window is *densified* (turned into a full
``timestamp`` by ``symbol`` grid, with NaN where a symbol has no bar) and
appended to the store, so peak memory depends on the window size rather than
on the whole date range.

``TimeChunkPlanner`` splits the observed timestamps into such windows.
``ChunkLedger`` is a JSON *sidecar*, a small bookkeeping file stored next to
the Zarr store, that records which windows earlier runs already appended, so
an interrupted conversion resumes at the first window not yet written.

Neither class depends on a dataset, a storage backend or a config. The module
imports only pandas, xarray and the atomic JSON writer, so it can never take
part in an import cycle.
