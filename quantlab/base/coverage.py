"""Coverage bookkeeping: which symbols are already downloaded for a date range.

Every acquisition run (a download from a data vendor) leaves one small JSON
*watermark sidecar* per symbol under the config's ``watermark_path``. A
sidecar records the date range of that symbol's data already on disk; its
``last_date`` is the *watermark*, the point up to which the symbol is known
to be downloaded. The run also writes a ``_failures.json`` manifest listing
the symbols whose download failed.

``CoverageLedger`` reads those files and answers the one question a refresh
needs: which of the requested symbols still have to be fetched for the
requested date range. It is the only implementation of that rule. The
acquisition engine in ``quantlab/base/acquisition.py`` creates a ledger and
delegates to it, and the source inspector (a read-only tool that reports
what is on disk) builds one through ``CoverageLedger.for_config``, so the
two always give the same answer.

This module reads local files only, sends no vendor requests and needs no
credentials. It imports nothing from the acquisition code, so a machine with
no API key can still inspect what it has on disk.

class CoverageLedger:
    """Read-only view of what is already on disk for one acquisition config.

    The ledger reads the per-symbol watermark sidecars and the failure
    manifest under ``watermark_root`` and classifies each requested symbol
    against the config's ``[start_date, end_date]`` range. This is the only
    place that comparison is made. Other components ask the ledger instead
    of repeating the rule, because the four-way classification
    (``uncovered``, ``covered``, ``widened``, ``legacy``) is easy to get
    subtly wrong.

    ``data_type`` is passed in rather than looked up on a vendor class, so a
    ledger can be built without creating a vendor client, and therefore
    without credentials. ``for_config`` does exactly that.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : AcquisitionConfig
        The acquisition config whose watermark directory to read.
    data_type : str or None, default None
        Kind of raw data, for example ``"quotes"`` or ``"trades"``. Needed
        only for tick-data frequencies, whose raw files are partitioned into
        directories by data type; ``None`` otherwise.
    legacy_policies : Sequence[str], default ``LEGACY_WATERMARK_POLICIES``
        Accepted values of the ``legacy_watermarks`` setting.
    default_legacy_policy : str, default ``"warn"``
        Policy used when ``legacy_watermarks`` is not set.
    owner_label : str, default "CoverageLedger"
        Name shown at the start of ``validate_symbols`` error messages.

    Examples
    --------
    With sidecars on disk for ``AAPL`` (fully covered), ``MSFT`` (no
    recorded start) and ``NVDA`` (recorded start later than requested,
    carrying the ``no_data`` marker), and none for ``TSLA``:

    >>> ledger = CoverageLedger.for_config(config)
    >>> pending, counts = ledger.partition_by_coverage(
    ...     ["AAPL", "MSFT", "NVDA", "TSLA"], from_watermark=False
    ... )
    >>> pending
    ['NVDA', 'TSLA']
    >>> counts

    """Reject any symbol that is not a well-formed ticker.

    Call this before building a file path or a vendor request from a
    symbol supplied by a caller. A symbol is used in two risky places. It
    becomes a directory name under the raw data root, where ``/`` or ``..``
    would escape the root. It also becomes one item of a comma-separated
    ``symbols=`` request parameter, where an embedded comma would silently
    change which symbols are requested. The pattern is the same one the
    roster builder filters on, so every symbol the builder saves is accepted
    here. It allows digits and up to two hyphenated suffixes (as in
    ``BRK-B``), both of which real tickers use.

    Parameters
    ----------
    symbols : Sequence[str]
        The symbols to check.
    owner_label : str
        Name reported at the front of the error message.
