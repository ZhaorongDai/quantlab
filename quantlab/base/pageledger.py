"""Per-batch page ledger for resumable, paginated vendor downloads.

Some vendors (Alpaca, for example) answer a request for several symbols as a
chain of pages. Each page carries an opaque ``next_page_token`` that the next
request must send back, and rows are sorted by symbol and then by bar
timestamp. A *batch* is one such multi-symbol request. Downloading the whole
market takes thousands of batches, some of them dozens of pages long, so an
interrupted run must be able to continue from the middle of a batch.
Restarting at page 0 pays again for every page already fetched, and guessing
a later page silently skips the symbols in between.

``PageLedger`` is a small JSON *sidecar* file (a bookkeeping file stored next
to the data it describes) that records, for one batch, which pages have been
fetched, which token the next request must carry, and which parquet *shards*
(the individual files the rows were written to) hold each page's rows.

The acquisition engine in ``quantlab/base/acquisition.py`` is the only
caller. The only project import is the atomic JSON writer in
``quantlab.utils.atomic``.

class PageLedger:
    """JSON sidecar recording which pages of one batch have been fetched.

    Ledgers live under ``{watermark_path}/_pages/``. ``watermark_path`` is
    the directory of per-symbol progress files, kept outside the raw data
    tree because a polars scan of that tree would fail on a ``.json`` file.

    There is one file per batch, and therefore one writer per file. Batches
    are fetched from several worker threads at once, and updating the
    in-memory record before each write is not atomic, so one shared file
    would need a lock. If these files are ever merged into one, a
    ``threading.Lock`` around the update and the write becomes necessary. A
    missing file is an empty ledger, which is the normal state on a first run.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        Location of the sidecar file; see ``default_path``.
    symbols : Sequence[str] or None, default None

        stored ledger whose ``symbol_fingerprint`` does not match this roster

    Attributes
    ----------
    path : str
