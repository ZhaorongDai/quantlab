"""Default device of the library heads.

A head resolves its device when training starts and again when a
checkpoint is loaded, not when the module is imported: CUDA when a CUDA
device is available, otherwise the CPU. Apple MPS is never chosen
automatically, because MPS runs are not deterministic and a macOS process
mixing torch and xgboost already needs ``OMP_NUM_THREADS=1``; pass
``device="mps"`` explicitly to use it.

``resolve_device`` is the one rule every head applies: an explicit device
wins, an unset one (``None``) becomes the library's default. The defaults
come from ``torch_default_device``, which asks torch (a pytabkit head has
imported it anyway), and ``xgboost_default_device``, which never imports
torch: ``xgboost_cuda_available`` reads xgboost's build information and,
only for a CUDA build, asks ``cuda_driver_device_count`` how many devices
the CUDA driver sees. That answer honours ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES``. It
creates no CUDA context, but ``cuInit`` does initialise the driver in the
calling process, so a process that later forks workers which use CUDA
should start them with the ``spawn`` method.
