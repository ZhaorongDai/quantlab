"""The config of the model layer.

A model is constructed from a ``ModelConfig`` and exposes it as ``self.config``. It is
frozen; the model's config setter normalises the config it is given into a new one.
The model's factors, labels and tracker are declared with ``component()`` and
written as their own configs.

    """Config of every model head, torch or library.

    It holds only what both variants read. Everything a variant or a head
    reads for training goes in ``hyperparameters``, one flat dict. The base
    classes and the shipped heads read these reserved keys from it:

    ``epochs``
        Epoch cap of a ``TorchModel``; default 100, a positive integer.
    ``lr``
        Learning rate of the default ``TorchModel._init_optim``; default
        ``1e-3``.
    ``early_stopping``, ``early_stopping_patience``
        The library's native early stopping in the shipped library heads;
        default off and 5 rounds (or the library's own unit).
    ``training_target``
        A ``LibraryModel``'s training target: ``"cs_rank"`` or
        ``"cs_zscore"``, applied per bar; unset trains on the raw label.
        Set, ``label_scales`` is ``"standardized"``; metrics still read the
        raw label.
    ``batch_size``, ``num_workers``, ``panel_device``, ``panel_dtype``
        Reserved for the torch data loader and training panel.

    A ``LibraryModel``'s ``_init_model`` receives the dict without the
    library keys above. A ``TorchModel``'s receives the whole dict, reserved
    keys included, so a torch head never splats it into a network; it reads
    its own keys by name, or drops the reserved ones with
    ``BaseModel.head_hyperparameters``.

    ``train_start``, ``train_end``, ``test_start`` and ``test_end`` bound the
    training and test windows; rolling cross-validation overwrites them fold
    by fold. ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` bound all the data the model
    collects; they are passed to every factor and label per request.
