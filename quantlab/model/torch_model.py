"""Torch variant of the model layer: ``TorchModel``, the base class of every torch head.

``TorchModel`` extends ``BaseModel`` with the epoch loop: the collected panel is held as a
``TrainingPanel`` of torch tensors, the head's ``_dataset`` hook turns it into a PyTorch
``Dataset`` (one cross-section per bar by default, see ``quantlab.model.torch_data``) and
``_dataloader`` batches it. A head implements the window, the network and the loss; every other
learning choice is an optional hook. Checkpoints are ``.pth`` files. Shipped heads live in

class TorchModel(TrainingTargetMixin, BaseModel):
    """Torch variant: standard PyTorch datasets and loaders, every learning choice a hook.

    The base class assembles the collected panel as a ``TrainingPanel`` of
    torch tensors and computes the training target once per fit. The head's
    ``_dataset`` hook turns it into a PyTorch ``Dataset`` and ``_dataloader``
    batches it. The default is one cross-section per step (ADR 0006): one
    bar's present symbols, each with its last ``window_bars`` bars, so the
    network sees ``[S_t, N, F]``; S_t changes from bar to bar, so it must not
    depend on the order or the number of symbols, and a symbol the model
    never saw in training still gets a prediction. Every sample carries its
    ``where`` (timestamp and symbol index), through which the base puts
    predictions back into the panel for any sample shape.

    The base class owns every data contract: the warm-up, the training
    target and its mask, moving batches to the device, the epoch loop,
    evaluation under ``no_grad`` in eval mode, the ``{split}_loss`` of each
    split, ``.pth`` checkpoints and prediction; the other metrics come from
    the model's evaluation after training (see ``BaseModel._evaluate``). A
    head writes three things:

    ``window_bars``
        N, the bars in each symbol's window.
    ``_init_model(num_features, num_labels, hyperparameters)``
        The ``nn.Module``; several networks go in an ``nn.ModuleDict``.
    ``_loss(output, batch)``
        The loss of one ``Batch`` from the network's raw output; count only
        ``batch.mask`` samples.

    and may override any of these, each of which has a working default:

    ``_dataset(panel, bars, training)``
        The PyTorch ``Dataset`` over ``bars``. Default:
        ``CrossSectionDataset``, one item per bar; ``SymbolSequenceDataset``
        gives Qlib-style ``(bar, symbol)`` samples batched to ``[B, N, F]``.
    ``_dataloader(dataset, training)``
        The ``DataLoader``. Default: ``batch_size`` and ``num_workers`` from
        the hyperparameters (``None`` and 0, one item per step), shuffled
        only in training with a generator seeded from ``random_seed``, the
        last batch never dropped.
    ``_transform_feature(x)``
        A batch's raw ``x``, NaN where a value or a bar is missing, to the
        network's input. Default: clip to ±3, NaN to 0.
    ``_transform_target(y, training)``
        One bar's raw ``[S_t, L]`` labels to ``(target, keep)``, computed
        once per fit; ``keep`` (or None) removes symbols from the loss only.
        Default: ``(y, None)``.
    ``_init_optim(model)``
        Default: Adam at ``hyperparameters["lr"]`` (``1e-3``), kept on
        ``self.optim``; a head may return anything its own
        ``_train_one_batch`` understands, such as a dict of optimizers.
    ``_train_one_batch(epoch, batch)``
        One optimisation step; returns the loss. Default: forward,
        ``_loss``, backward, gradient values clipped to ``grad_clip_value``
        (3.0; None disables), step.
    ``_val_one_batch(epoch, batch)``
        The evaluation loss of one batch. Default: ``_loss``.
    ``_test_one_batch(epoch, batch)``
        Called on every test batch after each epoch. Default: nothing.
    ``_forward(x)``
        The prediction, ``batch.mask.shape + (L,)``, from a transformed
        ``x``, used for metrics and ``predict_panel``. Default:
        ``self.model(x)``; override it when the network returns more than the
        prediction.
    ``_on_fit_start()``, ``_should_stop(epoch, train_loss, val_loss)``, ``_on_fit_end()``
        When to stop and which weights to keep. Default: run ``epochs``
        epochs, keep the last weights.

    ``epochs``, the epoch cap, is read from the hyperparameters (default
    100) and must be a positive integer; see ``RESERVED_HYPERPARAMETERS``
    for the other keys the base reads.

    The model's warm-up is N - 1 bars: every feature request, in training
    and in a backtest, starts that many bars earlier on each factor's
    dataset calendar, so the first requested bar has a full window.
